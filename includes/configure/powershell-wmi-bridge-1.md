Configure your devices using PowerShell scripts via the [MDM Bridge WMI Provider](/windows/win32/dmwmibridgeprov/mdm-bridge-wmi-provider-portal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For all device settings, the WMI Bridge client must be executed as SYSTEM (LocalSystem) account.

To test the PowerShell script, you can:

1. [Download the psexec tool](/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
1. Open an elevated command prompt and run: `psexec.exe -i -s powershell.exe`
1. Run the script in the PowerShell session
