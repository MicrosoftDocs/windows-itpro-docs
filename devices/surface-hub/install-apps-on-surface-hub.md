# Install apps on your Microsoft Surface Hub


Admins can install apps can from either the Windows Store or the Windows Store for Business.

## Using the Windows Store


Admins can install apps on the device using the Windows Store app available in **Settings** &gt; **System** &gt; **Microsoft Surface Hub**. They can start the store app, sign in using their Microsoft account credentials, browse, purchase, and install the apps as with any other Windows device.

## Using the Store for Business


For apps purchased through the Store for Business, download the Appxbundle, offline license, and the dependencies for the App from the store to a separate PC. Create a provisioning package and copy it to a USB drive. (See [Create a provisioning package](provisioning-packages-for-certificates-surface-hub.md).) Move the USB drive to the Surface Hub, and install the app on the device using the Settings app.
