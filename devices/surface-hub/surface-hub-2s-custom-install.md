# Customize wall mount of Surface Hub 2S

If you’re not using certified mounting solutions, you can mount Surface Hub 2S using readily available retail hardware.

## Set wall mount measurements

Surface Hub 2S recommended mounting measurements:

|**Item**|**Description**|**Notes**|
|:------ |:------------- |:------- |
|**Height from bottom of Surface Hub 2S**| 1026.5 mm (40.41”) | Recommended |
|**Height from top of Surface Hub 2S**| 1767.2 mm (69.57”) | Recommended |
|**Height from center of mount**| 1397 mm (55”) | Recommended |

1. Measure 1026.5 mm (40.41”) from the floor level to set the recommended minimum height.
2. Measure 1767.2 mm (69.57”) from the floor level to set the recommended top height.

3. Measure 1397 mm (55”) mm from the floor level to set the recommended center height.

## Obstruction free mounting

In addition to the visible ports on the sides of the device, certain integrated components must remain free of obstruction in order to function correctly. These include the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, occupancy, and mic sensors as well thermal cooling vents.
 Keep out zones

|**Item**|**Description**|**Notes**|
|:---- |:----------- |:----- |
|**Access**| Ensure unimpeded access to input/output ports, the compute cartridge, Bluetooth radio, Bluetooth sensor, Wi-Fi radio, Wi-Fi sensor, occupancy sensor. | See Figure 1. |
|**Air flow**| Avoid blocking inlet and outlet air vent zones. | See Figure 2  |
|**Audio**| Avoid blocking audio exit zone on rear of Surface Hub 2S. | See Figure 2. |

The removable compute cartridge containing the I/O ports must remain free of any obstructions or impediments of any kind.

## Selecting a mounting system

Surface Hub 2S uses a 350 mm x 350 mm mounting framework that meets most — but not all — of the criteria listed in the VESA Flat Display Mounting Interface Standard. You can install Surface Hub 2S using any of various off-the-shelf display brackets designed to accommodate displays that diverge from exact VESA specifications, as shown below.

On the back of Surface Hub 2S, you’ll find a square pattern of four M6 x 1.0 threaded holes centered on the circular bump (565 mm in diameter). Attach your mount using four M6 x 1.0–12 mm-long metric bolts. Or, depending on preference, you can use longer bolts up to a maximum of 20 mm.
Important considerations for mounting systems

|**Item**|**Description**|**Notes**|
|:------ |:------------- |:------- |
|**Strength**| Only choose mounts that can safely support devices of at least 28 kg (62 lbs.). | Required |
|**Stiffness**| Avoid flexible display mounts that can diminish the interactive pen and touch use experience. Most TV mounts are not designed to support touch displays. | Recommended |
|**Depth**| Keep the device mounted tightly to the wall especially in corridors and along circulation paths within rooms.| Recommended |
|**Versatility**| Ensure your mounting solution remains hidden from view in both the existing landscape mode and any  potential portrait mode (subject to future availability). | Recommended |

## Mounting methods compatible with Surface Hub 2S

Rail mounts typically have multiple holes and a set of slots, enabling compatibility across a wide range of displays. A rail attached to the wall and two mounts attached to the display enable you to securely install Surface Hub 2S to a wall. Most rail mounts widely available for retail are compatible with Surface Hub 2S.
