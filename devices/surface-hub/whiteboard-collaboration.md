# Set up and use Microsoft Whiteboard 

# Set up and use Microsoft Whiteboard

The Microsoft Whiteboard app includes the capability for Surface Hubs and other devices to collaborate in real time on the same board.

## Prerequisites

To use whiteboard collaboration complete the following actions:

- Add  Whiteboard.ms, whiteboard.microsoft.com, and wbd.ms to your list of allowed sites.
- Open port: **HTTPS: 443** (normally configured when you first run Surface Hub.)

## Office 365 requirements

- Whiteboard collaboration is only supported in the Office 365 commercial environment and requires Office 365 with cloud-based Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
- You can only run collaborative sessions among users belonging to the same Office 365 tenant.
- Office 365 Germany or Office 365 operated by 21Vianet do not support whiteboard collaboration.

## Using Whiteboard collaboration

To start a collaboration session:

1. In the Whiteboard app, tap the **Sign in** button.
2. Sign in with your organization ID.
3. Tap the **Invite** button next to your name at the top of the app.
4. Write or type the names of the colleagues you wish to collaborate with.

On the other device, such as a Surface Hub, when you are signed in, the shared board will now appear in the board gallery.

### User tips
- Log in to access your whiteboards. As you work, changes are saved automatically.
- Name your whiteboards to help organize your content and find it quickly. Select the … to open the menu. Select the **Options** gear icon to access more tools and features of the Whiteboard.
- Use **Ink to shape** to turn drawing into actual shapes like circles, squares, and triangles.
- Use **Ink to table** to turn a drawn grid into a table with rows and columns.
- You can also change the background color and design from solid to grid or dots. Pick the background, then choose the color from the wheel around it.
- You can export a copy of the Whiteboard collaboration for yourself through the Share charm and leave the board for others to continue working.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are using Whiteboard and cannot sign in, you can collaborate by joining a Teams or Skype for Business meeting, and then sharing your screen. After you’re done, tap **Settings** > **Export to email** or save a copy of the board. The SVG export provides higher resolution than PNG and can be opened in a web browser.

## New features in Whiteboard

The Microsoft Whiteboard app, updated for Surface Hub on July 1, 2019 includes a host of new features including:
