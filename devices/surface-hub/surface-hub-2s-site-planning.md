# Surface Hub 2S site planning

## Introduction

Designed for team collaboration, Surface Hub 2S can transform the way you work  —  not only in the conference rooms but any place you want to work. One of the biggest advantages of Surface Hub 2S is the ability to move it from one space to another when used with the Steelcase Roam mobile stand and mobile battery. Providing unplugged, uninterrupted teamwork capabilities, Surface Hub 2S can be integrated into almost any workspace.

## Room considerations

Designed for interactive use in smaller conference rooms and huddle spaces, Surface Hub 2S provides a 4K camera, microphone array, crystal clear speakers, and a brilliant 4K+ resolution display. Optimizing the user experience in larger spaces with more people further away from the display may require peripherals such as an extra camera, microphone, or room systems solution such as Microsoft Teams Rooms. Use the following proximity guidance to determine if you need to plan for peripherals.


| **Room/Space**               | **Participants** | **Proximity**        | **Additional peripherals** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Collaboration – Huddle space | 1-3          | 1–2 meters           | None                       |
| Collaboration – Lounge space | 3-6          | More than 2.3m       | Peripherals Recommended    |
| Small meeting room           | 4-6          | Up to 2.3 meters     | None                       |
| Medium, Larger meeting rooms | 6 +          | More than 2.3 meters | Peripherals recommended    |


As a general guideline, install Surface Hub 2S in a space that meets the following criteria:

- People can reach all four edges of the touchscreen.
- The screen is not in direct sunlight, which could affect viewing or damage the screen.
- Ventilation openings are not blocked.
- Microphones are not affected by noise sources, such as fans or vents.
- Space is well lit with no reflective sources.

Whether mounted to a wall or installed on the mobile stand, the areas where you use the device should maintain:

- Room temperatures no cooler than 10°C (50° F) and no hotter than 35°C  (95° F).
- Relative humidity no lower than 20 percent and no higher than 80 percent.

## Managing Surface Hub 2S location

If you plan to use Surface Hub 2S on a mobile stand, you may wish to explore third-party solutions that enable location services. For example, active RFID systems can provide real-time tracking throughout complex office or industrial spaces. For more information, see your A/V provider or other third-party expertise for guidance.
