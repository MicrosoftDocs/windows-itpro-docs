# Windows Virtual Desktop on Surface

## Introduction

Windows Virtual Desktop on Surface lets you run Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) on a Surface device blurring the lines between the local desktop experience and the virtual desktop where touch, pen, ink, and biometric authentication span both physical and virtual environments. Representing another milestone in the evolution of computing, Windows Virtual Desktop on Surface <a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> combines Microsoft 365 - virtualized in the Azure cloud - with the advanced security protections, enterprise-level manageability, and enhanced productivity tools of Windows 10 on Surface.  This fusion of premium form factor and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure in Azure provides exceptional customer value across user experiences, portability, security, business continuity, and modern management.

### Windows Virtual Desktop

Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) is a comprehensive desktop and app virtualization service running in the Azure cloud. It’s the only virtual desktop infrastructure that delivers simplified management, multi-session Windows 10, optimizations for Office 365 ProPlus, and support for Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environments. With WVD you can quickly deploy and scale Windows desktops and apps on Azure and get built-in security and compliance features.

### Windows Virtual Desktop partner integrations

For a list of approved partner providers and independent software vendors for Windows Virtual Desktop, see [Windows Virtual Desktop partner integrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/partners). Some partners also provide Virtual Desktop as a Service (DaaS). DaaS frees you from having to maintain your own virtual machines (VMs) by providing a fully managed, turnkey desktop and virtualization service. The ability to deliver customized desktops to users anywhere in the world enables companies to quickly adjust to changing market conditions by spinning up cloud desktops on-demand - when and where they’re needed.
 
## Microsoft Surface Devices

Surface engineering has long set new standards for innovation by going beyond the keyboard and mouse to imagine more natural ways of interacting with devices, whether by touch, voice, ink, or Surface Dial. And with chip-to-cloud integration of Microsoft 365 and the security and manageability of Windows 10 Pro, Surface delivers connected hardware, software, apps, and services the way they were intended. Although it’s possible to run WVD from Windows devices dating back to Windows 7, Microsoft Surface devices provide unique advantages including support for:

- **Flexible form factors** - like 2-in-1 devices such as Surface Go 2, Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro X with pen, touch and detachable keyboard.
- **Persistent, on-demand and just-in-time work scenarios** - with offline and on-device access for more productive experiences.
- **Windows 10 modern device security and manageability** - providing the flexibility to be productive anywhere.

## Flexible form factors and premium user experience

The Microsoft Surface for Business family comprises a diverse portfolio of form factors including traditional laptops, all-in-one machines, and 2-in-1 devices. Surface devices deliver experiences people love with the choice and flexibility they need in order to work on their terms.

### The modern virtual desktop endpoint

Surface 2-in-1 devices, including [Surface Go 2](https://www.microsoft.com/p/surface-go-2) (10.5”), [Surface Pro 7](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/devices/surface-pro-7/) (12”) and [Surface Pro X](https://www.microsoft.com/p/surface-pro-x/) (13”), provide users with the ideal cloud desktop endpoint bringing together the optimal balance of portability, versatility, power, and all-day battery.

### Offline and on-device access for more productive experiences

Traditionally, VDI solutions only work when the endpoint is connected to the internet. But what happens when the internet or power is unavailable for any reason (due to mobility, being on a plane, or power outages, and so on)?
 
To support business continuity and keep employees productive, Surface devices can easily augment the virtual desktop experience with offline access to files, Microsoft 365 and third-party applications. Traditional apps like Microsoft Office, available across .x86, x64, Universal Windows Platform, ARM platforms, enable users to stay productive in “offline mode”. Files from the virtual desktop cloud environment can be synced locally on Surface using OneDrive for Business for offline access as well. You can have the confidence that all locally “cached” information is up-to-date and secure.

In addition to adding support for offline access to apps and files, Surface devices are designed to optimize collaborative experiences like Microsoft Teams “On-Device”. Although some VDI solutions support the use of Teams through a virtual session, users can benefit from the more optimized experience provided by a locally installed instance of Teams. Localizing communications and collaboration apps for multimedia channels like voice, video, live captioning allows organizations to take full advantage of Surface devices’ ability to provide optimized Microsoft 365 experiences. The emergence of Surface artificial intelligence (AI) or “AI-on-device” brings new capabilities to life, such as eye gaze technology that adjusts the appearance of your eyes so the audience sees you looking directly at the camera when communicating via video.
 
An alternative to locally installing traditional applications is to take advantage of the latest version of Microsoft Edge, which comes with support for Progressive Web Apps (PWA). PWAs are just websites that are progressively enhanced to function like native apps on supporting platforms. The qualities of a PWA combine the best of the web and native apps by additional features, such as push notifications, background data refresh, offline support, and more.

### Virtual GPUs

GPUs are ideal for AI compute and graphics-intensive workloads, helping customers to fuel innovation through scenarios like high-end remote visualization, deep learning, and predictive analytics.  However, this isn’t ideal for professionals who need to work remotely or while on the go because varying degrees of internal GPU horsepower are tied to the physical devices, limiting mobility and flexibility.
 
To solve for this Azure offers the N-series family of Virtual Machines with NVIDIA GPU capabilities (vGPU). With vGPUs, IT can either share GPU performance across multiple virtual machines, or power demanding workloads by assigning multiple GPUs to a single virtual machine. For Surface this means that no matter what device you’re using, from the highly portable Surface Go 2 to the slim and stylish Surface Laptop 3, your device has access to powerful server-class graphics performance.  Surface and vGPUs allow you to combine all the things you love about Surface, to include pen, touch, keyboard, trackpad and PixelSense displays, with graphics capability only available in high performance computing environments. 
 
Azure N-series brings these capabilities to life on your Surface device allowing you to work in any way you want, wherever you go.  [Learn more about Azure N-Series and GPU optimized virtual machine sizes.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu)
