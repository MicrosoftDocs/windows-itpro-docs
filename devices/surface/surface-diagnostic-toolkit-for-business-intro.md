# Fix common Surface problems using the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business

If your Surface isn’t working properly, the Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business can help you or your administrator find and solve problems.

> [!NOTE]
> Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business is built for commercial devices. If your device is a personal device and not managed by your work or school run the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit) instead.

## Run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business

Before you run the diagnostic tool, make sure you have the latest Windows updates. Go to [Install Surface and Windows 10 updates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates) for more information. If that doesn't solve the problem, you'll need to run the diagnostic tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business only works on Surface devices running Windows 10. It does  not work on Surface Pro, Surface Pro 2, or Surface devices configured in S mode.

**To run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business:**

1. Download the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business](https://aka.ms/SDT4B).
2. Select Run and follow the on-screen instructions.

The diagnosis and repair time averages 15 minutes but could take an hour or longer, depending on internet connection speed and the number of updates or repairs required.
