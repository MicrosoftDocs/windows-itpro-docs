# Use your voice with HoloLens

You can use your voice to do almost anything on HoloLens, like taking a quick photo or opening an app.  Many voice commands are built into HoloLens, others are available through Cortana.

This article will teach you how to control HoloLens and your holographic world with your voice and with Cortana.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Speech is only supported in [some languages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039262#Languages).  The speech language is based on the Windows display language, not the keyboard language.  
> You can verify the Windows display language in **Settings** > **Time and Language** > **Language**.

## Built-in voice commands

Get around HoloLens faster with these basic commands.  If you turn Cortana off, "Hey Cortana" voice commands won't be available, but you'll still be able to use the following built-in voice commands.

### General speech commands

Use these commands throughout Windows Mixed Reality to get around faster. Some commands use the gaze cursor, which you bring up by saying “select.”

| Say this | To do this |
| - | - |
| "Select" | Say "select" to bring up the gaze cursor. Then, turn your head to position the cursor on the thing you want to select, and say “select” again. |
|Open the Start menu | "Go to Start" |
|Leave an immersive app | Say "Go to Start" to bring up the quick actions menu, then say "Mixed reality home." |
|See available speech commands | "What can I say?" |

### 3D object commands

To use these commands, gaze at a 3D object, hologram, or app window.

| Say this | To do this |
| - | - |
| "Bigger" | Make it bigger |
| "Smaller" | Make it smaller |
| "Face me" | Turn it to face you |
| "Move this" | Move it (follow your gaze) |
| "There" | Place it when you’re done moving it |

### See it, say it

Many buttons and other elements on HoloLens also respond to your voice—for example, **Adjust** and **Close** on the app bar. To find out if a button is voice-enabled, rest your gaze on it for a moment. If it is, you'll see a voice tip.

### Dictation mode

Tired of typing? Switch to dictation mode any time the holographic keyboard is active. Select the microphone icon to get started, or say "Start dictating." To stop dictating, select **Done** or say "Stop dictating." To delete what you just dictated, say "Delete that."

> [!NOTE]
> You need an Internet connection to use dictation mode.

HoloLens dictation uses explicit punctuation, meaning that you say the name of the punctuation you want to use. For instance, you might say "Hey **comma** what are you up to **question mark**."

Here are the punctuation keywords you can use:

- Period, comma, question mark, exclamation point/exclamation mark
- New line/new paragraph
- Semicolon, colon
- Open quote(s), close quote(s)
- Hashtag, smiley/smiley face, frowny, winky
- Dollar, percent

Sometimes it's helpful to spell out things like email addresses. For instance, to dictate example@outlook.com, you'd say "E X A M P L E at outlook dot com."

## Do more with Cortana

Cortana can help you do all kinds of things on your HoloLens, from searching the web to shutting down your device. To get her attention, select Cortana  on Start or say "Hey Cortana" anytime.

Here are some things you can try saying (remember to say "Hey Cortana" first).

**Hey, Cortana**...

- What can I say?
- Increase the volume.
- Decrease the brightness.
- Shut down.
- Restart.
- Go to sleep.
- Mute.
- Launch `<app name>`.
- Move `<app name>` here (gaze at the spot you want the app to move to).
- Go to Start.
- Take a picture.
- Start recording. (Starts recording a video.)
- Stop recording. (Stops recording a video.)
- Call `<contact>`. (Requires Skype.)
- What time is it?
- Show me the latest NBA scores. 
- How much battery do I have left?
- Tell me a joke.

Some Cortana features you're used to from Windows on your PC or phone (for example, reminders and notifications) aren't supported in Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition. Cortana on HoloLens is English-only, and the Cortana experience may vary among regions.

### Turn Cortana off

Cortana is on the first time you use HoloLens. You can turn her off in Cortana's settings. In the **All apps** list, select **Cortana > Settings**. Then turn off Cortana can give you suggestions, ideas, reminders, alerts, and more.

If Cortana isn't responding to "Hey Cortana," go to Cortana's settings and check to make sure she's on.
