# Use your voice with HoloLens

You can use your voice to do many of the same things you do with gestures on HoloLens, like taking a quick photo or opening an app.

## Voice commands

Get around HoloLens faster with these basic commands.  If you turn Cortana off, "Hey Cortana" voice commands won't be available, but you'll still be able to use the following built-in voice commands.

**Select**. Use this instead of air tap. Gaze at a hologram, then say "Select."

**Go to start**. Say "Go to Start" anytime to bring up the **Start** menu. Or when you're in an immersive app, say "Go to Start" to get to the quick actions menu.

**Move this**. Instead of air tapping and dragging an app, say "Move this" and use gaze to move it.

**Face me**. Gaze at a hologram, and then say "Face me" to turn it your way.

**Bigger/Smaller**. Gaze at a hologram, and then say "Bigger" or "Smaller" to resize it.

Many buttons and other elements on HoloLens also respond to your voice&mdash;for example, **Adjust** and **Close** on the app bar. To find out if a button is voice-enabled, rest your gaze on it for a moment. If it is, you'll see a voice tip.

## Dictation mode

Tired of typing? Switch to dictation mode any time the holographic keyboard is active. Select the microphone icon to get started, or say "Start dictating." To stop dictating, select **Done** or say "Stop dictating." To delete what you just dictated, say "Delete that."

> [!NOTE]
> You need an Internet connection to use dictation mode.

HoloLens dictation uses explicit punctuation, meaning that you say the name of the punctuation you want to use. For instance, you might say "Hey **comma** what are you up to **question mark**."

Here are the punctuation keywords you can use:

- Period, comma, question mark, exclamation point/exclamation mark
- New line/new paragraph
- Semicolon, colon
- Open quote(s), close quote(s)
- Hashtag, smiley/smiley face, frowny, winky
- Dollar, percent

Sometimes it's helpful to spell out things like email addresses. For instance, to dictate example@outlook.com, you'd say "E X A M P L E at outlook dot com."

## Do more with Cortana

Cortana can help you do all kinds of things on your HoloLens, from searching the web to shutting down your device. To get her attention, select Cortana  on Start or say "Hey Cortana" anytime.

Here are some things you can try saying (remember to say "Hey Cortana" first):

- What can I say?
- Increase the volume.
- Decrease the brightness.
- Shut down.
- Restart.
- Go to sleep.
- Mute.
- Launch `<app name>`.
- Move `<app name>` here (gaze at the spot you want the app to move to).

- Stop recording. (Stops recording a video.)

- How much battery do I have left?
- Tell me a joke.

>- If Cortana isn't responding to "Hey Cortana," go to Cortana's settings and check to make sure she's on.
