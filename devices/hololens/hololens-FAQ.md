## My holograms don't look right or are moving around

If your holograms don't look right (for example, they're jittery or shaky, or you see black patches on top of them), try one of these fixes:

- [Clean your device visor](hololens1-hardware.md#care-and-cleaning) and make sure nothing is blocking the sensors.
- Make sure that you're in a well-lit room that does not have a lot of direct sunlight.
- Try walking around and gazing at your surroundings so that HoloLens can scan them more completely.
- If you've placed a lot of holograms, try removing some.

If you're still having problems, trying running the Calibration app. This app calibrates your HoloLens just for you to help keep your holograms looking their best. To do this, go to **Settings** > **System** > **Utilities**. Under **Calibration**, select **Open Calibration**.

## I see a message that says "Finding your space"

When HoloLens is learning or loading a space, you may see a brief message that says "Finding your space." If this message displays for more than a few seconds, you'll see another message under the Start menu that says "Still looking for your space."

These messages mean that HoloLens is having trouble mapping your space. When this happens, you can open apps, but you can't place holograms in your environment.

If you see these messages often, try one or more of the following fixes:

- Make sure that you're in a well-lit room that does not have a lot of direct sunlight.
- Make sure that your device visor is clean. [Learn how to clean your visor](hololens1-hardware.md#care-and-cleaning).
- Make sure that you have a strong Wi-Fi signal. If you enter a new environment that has no Wi-Fi or a weak Wi-Fi signal, HoloLens won't be able find your space. Check your Wi-Fi connection by going to **Settings** > **Network &amp; Internet** > **Wi-Fi**.
- Try moving more slowly.

## I'm not seeing the holograms that I expect to see in my space

If you don't see the holograms that you placed, or if you're seeing some that you don't expect, try one or more of the following fixes:

- Turn on some lights. HoloLens works best in a well-lit space.
- Remove holograms that you don't need by going to **Settings** > **System** > **Holograms** > **Remove nearby holograms**. Or, if needed, select **Remove all holograms**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the layout or lighting in your space changes significantly, your device might have trouble identifying your space and showing your holograms.

## I can't place holograms where I want to

Here are some things to try if you're having trouble placing holograms:

- Stand between one and three meters from where you're trying to place the hologram.
- Don't place holograms on black or reflective surfaces.
- Make sure that you're in a well-lit room that does not have a lot of direct sunlight.
- Walk around the rooms so HoloLens can rescan your surroundings. To see what's already been scanned, air tap to reveal the mapping mesh graphic.

[Back to list](#list)

## Holograms disappear or are encased in other holograms or objects

If you get too close to a hologram, it will temporarily disappear&mdash;to restore the hologram, just move away from it. Also, if you've placed several holograms close together, some may disappear. Try removing a few.

Holograms can also be blocked or encased by other holograms or by objects such as walls. If this happens, try one of the following fixes:

- If the hologram is encased in another hologram, move the encased hologram to another location. To do this, select **Adjust**, then tap and hold to position it.
- If the hologram is encased in a wall, select **Adjust**, then walk toward the wall until the hologram appears. Tap and hold, then pull the hologram forward and out of the wall.
- If you can't move the hologram by using gestures, use your voice to remove it. Gaze at the hologram, then say "Remove." Then reopen the hologram and place it in a new location.

[Back to list](#list)

## I can see holograms that are on the other side of a wall

If you're very close to a wall, or if HoloLens hasn't scanned the wall yet, you can see holograms that are in the next room. To scan the wall, stand between one and three meters from the wall and gaze at it.

A black or reflective object (for example, a black couch or a stainless steel refrigerator) near the wall may cause problems when HoloLens tries to scan the wall. If there is such an object, scan the other side of the wall.

[Back to list](#list)

## When I place a hologram on a wall, the hologram seems to float

A hologram that you place on a wall typically appears to be an inch or so away from the wall. If it appears to be farther away, try one or more of the following fixes:

- When you place a hologram on a wall, stand between one and three meters from the wall and face the wall straight on.
- Air tap the wall to reveal the mapping mesh graphic. Make sure that the mesh aligns with the wall. If it doesn't, remove the hologram, rescan the wall, and then try again.
- If the issue persists, run the Calibration app. You'll find it in **Settings** > **System** > **Utilities**.

## Apps appear too close to me when I'm trying to move them

Try walking around and looking at the area where you're placing the app so that HoloLens scans the area from different angles. [Cleaning your device visor](hololens1-hardware.md#care-and-cleaning) may also help.

[Back to list](#list)

## I'm getting a low disk space error

Free up some storage space by doing one or more of the following:

- Remove some of the holograms that you've placed, or remove some saved data from within apps. [How do I find my data?](holographic-data.md)
- Delete some pictures and videos in the Photos app.
- Uninstall some apps from your HoloLens. In the **All apps** list, tap and hold the app you want to uninstall, then select **Uninstall**. (Uninstalling the app also deletes any data that the app stores on the device.)

## HoloLens doesn't respond to my gestures

To make sure that HoloLens can see your gestures, keep your hand in the gesture frame. The gesture frame extends a couple of feet on either side of you. HoloLens can also best see your hand when you hold it about 18 inches in front of your body (though you don't have to be precise about this). When HoloLens can see your hand, the cursor changes from a dot to a ring. Learn more about [using gestures in HoloLens 2](hololens2-basic-usage.md) or [using gestures in HoloLens (1st gen)](hololens1-basic-usage.md).

## HoloLens doesn't respond to my voice

HoloLens (1st gen) and HoloLens 2 have built-in speech recognition, and also support Cortana (online speech recognition).

### Built-in voice commands do not work

On HoloLens (1st gen), built-in speech recognition is not configurable. It is always turned on. On HoloLens 2, you can choose whether to turn on both speech recognition and Cortana during device setup.

If your HoloLens 2 is not responding to your voice, make sure Speech recognition is turned on. Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Speech** and turn on **Speech recognition**.

### Cortana or Dictation doesn't work

If Cortana or Dictation isn't responding to your voice, make sure online speech recognition is turned on. Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Speech** and verify the **Online speech recognition** settings. 

If Cortana is still not responding, do one of the following to verify that Cortana itself is turned on:

- In **All apps**, select **Cortana** > select **Menu** > **Notebook** > **Settings** to make changes.
- On HoloLens 2, select the **Speech settings** button or say "Speech settings."

To learn more about what you can say, see [Use your voice with HoloLens](hololens-cortana.md).

## I'm having problems pairing or using a Bluetooth device

If you're having problems [pairing a Bluetooth device](hololens-connect-devices.md), try the following:

- Go to **Settings** > **Devices**, and make sure that Bluetooth is turned on. If it is, turn it off and on again.
- Make sure that your Bluetooth device is fully charged or has fresh batteries.
- If you still can't connect, [restart the HoloLens](hololens-recovery.md).

[Back to list](#list)

## HoloLens Settings lists devices as available, but the devices don't work

HoloLens doesn't support Bluetooth audio profiles. Bluetooth audio devices, such as speakers and headsets, may appear as available in HoloLens settings, but they aren't supported.

If you're having trouble using a Bluetooth device, make sure that it's a supported device. Supported devices include the following:

- English-language QWERTY Bluetooth keyboards (you can use these anywhere that you use the holographic keyboard).
- Bluetooth mice.
- The [HoloLens clicker](hololens1-clicker.md).

You can pair other Bluetooth HID and GATT devices together with your HoloLens. However, you may have to install corresponding companion apps from Microsoft Store to actually use the devices.

[Back to list](#list)

## I'm having problems using the HoloLens clicker

Use the [clicker](hololens1-clicker.md) to select, scroll, move, and resize holograms. Individial apps may support additional clicker gestures.

If you're having trouble using the clicker, make sure that it's charged and paired with your HoloLens. If the battery is low, the indicator light blinks amber. To verify that the clicker is paired, go to **Settings** > **Devices** and see if it shows up there. For more information, see [Pair the clicker](hololens-connect-devices.md#hololens-1st-gen-pair-the-clicker).

If the clicker is charged and paired and you're still having problems, reset it by holding down the main button and the pairing button for 15 seconds. Then pair the clicker with your HoloLens again.

If resetting the clicker doesn't help, see [Restart or recover the HoloLens clicker](hololens1-clicker.md#restart-or-recover-the-clicker).

## I can't connect to Wi-Fi

Here are some things to try if you can't connect your HoloLens to a Wi-Fi network:

- Make sure that Wi-Fi is turned on. To check, use the Start gesture, then select **Settings** > **Network &amp; Internet** > **Wi-Fi**. If Wi-Fi is on, try turning it off and then on again.
- Move closer to the router or access point.
- Restart your Wi-Fi router, then [restart HoloLens](hololens-recovery.md). Try connecting again.
- If none of these things work, check to make sure that your router is using the latest firmware. You can find this information on the manufacturer website.

## I can't sign in to a HoloLens device because it was previously set up for someone else

If your device was previously set up for someone else, either for a client or for a former employee, and you don't have their password to unlock the device, you can do one of the following:

- For a device that is enrolled in Intune mobile device management (MDM), you can use Intune to remotely [wipe](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe) the device. The device then re-flashes itself.  
   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > When you wipe the device, make sure to leave **Retain enrollment state and user account** unchecked.
- For a non-MDM device, you can [put the device into **Flashing Mode** and use Advanced Recovery Companion](hololens-recovery.md#clean-reflash-the-device) to recover the device.

## Questions about managing HoloLens devices

### Can I use System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to manage HoloLens devices?

No. You have to use an MDM system to manage HoloLens devices.

### Can I use Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to manage HoloLens user accounts?

No. You have to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage user accounts for HoloLens devices.

### Is HoloLens capable of Automated Data Capture Systems (ADCS) auto-enrollment?

No.

### Can HoloLens participate in Integrated Windows Authentication?

No.

### Does HoloLens support branding?

No. However, you can work around this issue by using one of the following approaches:

- Create a custom app, and then [enable Kiosk mode](hololens-kiosk.md). The custom app can have branding, and can launch other apps (such as Remote Assist).  
- Change all of the user profile pictures in AAD to your company logo. However, this may not be desirable for all scenarios.

### What logging capabilities do HoloLens (1st gen) and HoloLens 2 offer?

Logging is limited to traces that can be captured in development or troubleshooting scenarios, or telemetry that the devices send to Microsoft servers.
