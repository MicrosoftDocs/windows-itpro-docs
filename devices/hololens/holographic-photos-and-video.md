# Create, share, and view photos and video

Use your HoloLens to take photos and videos that capture the holograms you've placed in your world.

To sync your photos and videos to OneDrive, open the OneDrive app and select **Settings** > **Camera upload**, and then turn on **Camera upload**.

## Take a photo on HoloLens (1st gen)

Use the [bloom gesture](hololens-use-gestures.md#the-bloom-gesture) to go to **Start**, and then select the Photos app.

Use gaze to position the photo frame, then air tap to take the picture. The picture will be saved to your collection in the Photos app.</p>

Want to snap a quick picture? Press the [volume up and volume down buttons](hololens-hardware.md#hololens-components) at the same time.

## Take a video on HoloLens (1st gen)

Use the bloom gesture to go to **Start**, then select **Video**. Use gaze to position the video frame, then air tap to start recording. To stop recording, use bloom once. The video will be saved to your collection in the Photos app.

To start recording more quickly, press and hold the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously until a 3-second countdown begins. To stop recording, tap both buttons.

> [!TIP]
> You can always have Cortana take a photo or a video for you. Just say "Hey Cortana, take a photo" or "Hey Cortana, take a video." [What else can I say to Cortana?](hololens-cortana.md)

## Find your photos and videos

To see your photos from OneDrive, select **More** > **Settings**, and then turn on **Show my cloud-only content from OneDrive**. (You'll need to sign in to the Photos app with your Microsoft account, if you haven't already.)

To pin a photo or video in your world, open it, then select **Place in mixed world**. Use tap and hold to move it to where you want it.

## Share photos and videos

To share images to a social network, in the Collection view, tap and hold the photo you want to share, then select **Share**. Select **Share Assistant**, then select the app that you want to share to.

You can also share directly from the camera app right after you take a photo - at the top of the image, select **Share**.
