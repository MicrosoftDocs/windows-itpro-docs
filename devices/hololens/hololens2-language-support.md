# Supported languages for HoloLens 2

HoloLens 2 is localized into the following languages. The localization features include speech commands and dictation, keyboard layouts, and OCR recognition within apps.

- Chinese Simplified (China)
- English (Australia)
- English (Canada)
- English (Great Britain)
- English (United States)
- French (Canada)
- French (France)
- German (Germany)
- Italian (Italy)
- Japanese (Japan)
- Spanish (Spain)

HoloLens 2 also supports the following languages. However, this support does not include speech commands or dictation features.

- Chinese Traditional (Taiwan and Hong Kong)
- Dutch (Netherlands)
- Korean (Korea)

Some features of HoloLens 2 use the Windows display language. The Windows display language affects the following settings for Windows and for apps that support localization:

- The user interface text language.
- The speech language.
- The default layout of the on-screen keyboard.

## Change the language or keyboard layout

The setup process configures your HoloLens for a specific region and language. You can change this configuration by using the **Time & language** section of **Settings**.

> [!NOTE]  
> Your speech and dictation language depends on (and is the same as) the Windows display language.

### To change the Windows display language

1. Open the **Start** menu, and then select **Settings** > **Time and language** > **Language**.
2. Select **Windows display language**, and then select a language.  

If the supported language that you're looking for is not in the menu, follow these steps:  

1. Under **Preferred languages**, select **Add a language**.
2. Locate and add the language.
3. Select the **Windows display language** menu again, and then select the language that you added in the previous step.

### To change the keyboard layout

To add or remove a keyboard layout, open the **Start** menu, and then select **Settings** > **Time & language** > **Keyboard**.

If your HoloLens has more than one keyboard layout, use the **Layout** key to switch between them. The **Layout** key is in the lower right corner of the on-screen keyboard.

> [!NOTE]  
> The on-screen keyboard can use Input Method Editor (IME) to enter characters in languages such as Chinese. However, HoloLens does not support external Bluetooth keyboards that use IME.
>  
> While you use IME together with the on-screen keyboard, you can continue to use a Bluetooth keyboard to type in English. To switch between keyboards, press the tilde character button (**~**).
