### Pair a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse

1. Turn on your keyboard or mouse and make it discoverable. The way you make it discoverable depends on the device. To learn how to do this, check the device or visit the manufacturer's website.

1. Use the bloom gesture (HoloLens (1st gen) or the start gesture (HoloLens 2) to go to **Start**, then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Devices** and make sure that Bluetooth is on. When you see the device name, select **Pair** and follow the instructions.

### Pair the clicker

> Applies to HoloLens (1st gen) only.

1. Use the bloom gesture to go to **Start**, then select **Settings**.

1. Select **Devices** and make sure that Bluetooth is on.
1. Use the tip of a pen to press and hold the clicker's pairing button until the status light blinks white. Make sure to hold the button down until the light starts blinking. [Where's the pairing button?](hololens1-clicker.md)
