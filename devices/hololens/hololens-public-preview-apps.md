# Preview new mixed reality apps for HoloLens

Microsoft has just announced two new mixed reality apps coming to HoloLens: Microsoft Remote Assist and Microsoft Layout.

The gap between the real and digital world limits our ability to take advantage of new technologies and transform how we work, learn, create, communicate, and live. **Mixed reality is here to close that gap**.

Mixed reality has the potential to help customers and businesses across the globe do things that until now, have never been possible. Mixed reality helps businesses and employees complete crucial tasks faster, safer, more efficiently, and create new ways to connect to customers and partners.
