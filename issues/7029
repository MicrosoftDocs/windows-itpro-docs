I noticed that my Microsoft Defender ATP for macOS has updated to version 101.01.54. As an IT admin I went to this "What's New" site to see what changes were made in this version and was very surprised to see the version I'm on is not listed. Please consider this a formal request to have the "what's new" updated with the new version being deployed at the time of deployment. If at all possible it would be really nice if the "what's new" was updated _before_ the new version release.
