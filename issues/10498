We've noticed an additional event ID (3096) in an environment that isn't listed in the document.  The Description of the event is "No change in active Code Integrity policy {GUID} AuditSignedandReputablewithTrustedInstallerRing0 after refresh. id {ID}. Status 0x0".  Would be great if that can be added for completeness.
