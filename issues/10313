Code 0x801c0451 is missing.

This fixed it for me:
_We dealt with this a bunch in our environment. What we found is that some PC's were showing duplicate accounts under "Email & Accounts" in settings. So, for example, when loading up the settings app in Windows and going into the "Email & Accounts" section, you might see 2 listings for user account "John.Doe@domain.com". This appears to cause issues in Windows (and Office), including with Hello setup. Not sure why the duplicate account shows up, but the solution is to go to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker and rename the "accounts" folder to "accounts.old" and reboot. The duplicate account will be gone after a reboot, and Hello should properly complete set up. We've also noticed this fixing several other issues, including Office 365 randomly showing "unlicensed product" for a user with an active E5 license. Whenever duplicate accounts show up, it eventually causes issues!__
