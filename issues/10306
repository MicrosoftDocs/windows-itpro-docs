The document states the following:
> In the above deployment model, a newly provisioned user will not be able to sign in using Windows Hello for Business until (a) Azure AD Connect successfully synchronizes the public key to the on-premises Active Directory and (b) device has line of sight to the domain controller for the first time.

Does the device must have a line of sight to the domain controller when the user registers to Windows Hello? When he first attempts to login using its Windows Hello PIN? Both?
