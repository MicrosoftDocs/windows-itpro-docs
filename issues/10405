An explanatory note for co-managed devices to leverage the enrollment method described in this Doc's link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/tutorial-co-manage-clients

This is the only supported way for using Device Credentials for co-managed devices since the GPO toggle for Device Credentials isnt supported on Co-managed devices.
