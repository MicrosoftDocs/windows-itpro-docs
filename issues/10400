Back Story: We have issues in our domain with computers most of the time not being able to check for windows updates. I've exhausted all troubleshooting steps I've found online. A while back we added the ability for Kaspersky's admin server to handle windows updates. It does a discovery process of scanning the PC. It seems like it first queries the target machine's windows update service then if that fails does its own discovery scan as a failback. Kaspersky also has issues getting results from the windows update service and the failback has worked for us most of the time.

I tried to do a little more research on the errors today and Kaspersky's discovery kicked back this error:
```
