The "Applies to" section says that this applies to Windows Server 2016 and above, however the Windows 10 version quoted is 1709, and we are being told by MS support that this feature isn't available until Windows Server 2019.

Please change the "Applies to" to refer to Windows Server 2019 rather than Server 2016, to avoid future customer confusion.
