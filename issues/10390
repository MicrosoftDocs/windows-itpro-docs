As of March 2022, this page no longer meets the guidlines of NIST SP 800-62 Paragraph 5.1.1.2. 

This guidance states "Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length. Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized secrets at least 64 characters in length."

It is recommended that the guidance from Microsoft is updated to reflect the NIST guidance.
