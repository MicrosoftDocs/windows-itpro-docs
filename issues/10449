Hello, 

i was project to make multi-app kiosk with AD user
Attached txt file with code


[New Text Document (2).txt](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/files/8352588/New.Text.Document.2.txt)
i used this guid 
https://techdirectarchive.com/2020/01/31/kiosk-mode-deployment-on-windows-10-with-an-ad-domain-account/

but after i runing this kiosk will create local user

the point is i need to create on AD user to reach some documentation which are in file server.

so maybe any ideas how to fix this.
