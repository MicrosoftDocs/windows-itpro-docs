[HI.  Please see Step 6 under "Create the Network Unlock Certificate" Here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-how-to-enable-network-unlock#create-the-network-unlock-certificate. It mentions setting up a "Friendly Name" but that doesn't seem to be what is required. It needs either a Subject Name or an Alternative Name, but the instructions are not clear about what to provide for either of those.  See this SpiceWorks article for details: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2149260-setting-up-bitlocker-network-unlock. Thank you!]
