Is it possible to add to the document which end-points can handle SSL interception?
For security reasons, proxy servers perform SSL interception to ensure no malicious things are in the https/ssl package. Endpoints which can't handle this, and service fail because of this, need to be excluded from this kind of interception.

If this kind of info would be available, it would make life easier for the security admin who is managing the proxy settings.
It would also ensure such security measures will not break Microsoft Services crucial for the good working of the OS.
