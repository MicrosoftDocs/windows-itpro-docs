Tell me about "Disable Memory integrity switch" policy

It is as follows
~~~~~
You must have Windows 10, version 1803 or later. The ADMX/ADML template files for earlier versions of Windows do not include these Group Policy settings.
~~~~~

But, Even if I check the latest admx/adml files , This policy item does not exist.
Where is admx/adml files that include this policy ?
