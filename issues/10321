Hi,

This page could use more actionable information. I am trying to understand what is being registered in DeviceEvents under actiontype AppControl*. 

It appears to contain items from the Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/EXE and DLL and Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational logs, but that doesn't appear to be all of it.

Secondly, I find it hard to figure out which time in the DeviceEvents table relates to the time the event was created in EventViewer.
There's several different times in the DeviceEvents table:

- TimeStamp (I believe this is the time the data was added to Defender for Endpoint)
- ProcessCreationTime
- InitiatingProcessCreationTime
- InitiatingProcessParentCreationTime

It seems the actual timestamp of the eventlog entry is not available.

I find it quite hard to work with the data around appcontrol data in Defender for Endpoint. There's equally zero information posted by anyone using this on the entire internet.
