Not for this page but for the "Windows Hello for Business features" (1 level up)

a) I miss the "Smartcard feature" enabled with Windows Certificate Trust described here:
- It should stated that Windows Hello could be used for Smartcard purposes (= User ceritficate). Please describe the features that it can be used for:
- Authentication against IIS Websites?
- Authentication for RDP
- Signing Office Documents (works we tested that - you can sign Word documents with hello Smartcard certificate)
- Signing PDFs?
- CodeSigning (including CodeSign EKU in Windows Hello Certificate Template on PKI)?
- E-Mail Signing S/MIME (including e-mail protection EKU in Windows Hello Certificate Template on PKI)?
 
b)The GPO setting for Windows Hello : "Use Windows Hello for Business as smart card certificates" should be describe
-> As far as I understand this GPO allows the smartcard unlock just with the Windows Hello Sign-In and does not have the need to always unlock with fingprint / PIN during sign-in session. This needs to be clarified why and where this should be used. Examples needed.
