Can you clarify this statement?
"/DefaultOutboundAction

This value is the action that the firewall does by default (and evaluates at the very end) on outbound connections. The merge law for this option is to let the value of the GroupPolicyRSoPStore win if it is configured; otherwise, the local store value is used. DefaultOutboundAction will block all outbound traffic unless it is explicitly specified not to block.

0x00000000 - allow
0x00000001 - block
Default value is 0 (allow)."

The statement "DefaultOutboundAction will block all outbound traffic unless it is explicitly specified not to block." seems to mean that the default state is Block. But the statement "Default value is 0 (allow)" seems to mean that the default state is to allow.
