heres my need - I have trouble thinking its not a regular occurrence.

I bought a new asus gaming laptop and a 2nd NVME to hold and run linux.
I installed fedora, everything was fine
until I unlocked the secure-boot and booted

now I boot windows and get the blue-bitlock of death

of course I dont have a key, despite the "hel.pful" url on-screen 
telling me where go get it.  maybe I used a new outlook email to 
register it, but theres nothing to recover.

I would think a whole new page for bitlocked - out by UIFI secure boot
could help.
