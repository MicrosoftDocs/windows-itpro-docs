If a user connects to VPN after sign-in with WHFB PIN or BIO, they cannot access on-prem resource until they lock/unlock screen with WHFB credential.

The workaround is also discussed in this article.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/group-membership-changes-not-updating-over-some-vpn-connections#workarounds

1. Use a VPN that establishes a client connection before the user signs in.
2. Sign in to the client computer, and then connect to the VPN as you usually do.
    When you are sure that the client computer is connected to the VPN, lock Windows.
    Unlock the client computer, and then sign out of Windows.
    Sign in to Windows again.

Should we add this portion to the doc as more and more customers are using AADJ with WHFB?
