This about connecting from w10 (pro) to w11 (pro) using `AzureAd\username@orgdomain.etc`. 

I followed the directions on 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/connect-to-remote-aadj-pc

Those instructions do not get anywhere close to working me. I have found many guides that do the following additional steps to make this work
1. Text edit the RDP config file to this:
- `enablecredsspsupport:i:0`
- `authenticcation level:i:2` 
**NOTE: This is NOT what the [Note: If you cannot connect using Remote Desktop Connection 6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-connection-6-prompts-credentials) says! Different values!**
2. Rdp Client: Disable persistent bitmap caching to prevent blackscreen 
3. RDP to get **remote login screen**
4. Fill in `AzureAd\username@orgdomain.etc` / `password` and there

As a user, I spent an insane amount of time on figuring this, but now I'm somewhat unsure about how to go about making a PR to this docs page since this was a pretty epic level of not working and I obviously don't understand the details of RDP and how to debug it

i would be happier if a simpler solution was found or an update is coming etc, but this pain needs to stop
