Hi,

I think it would be very helpful to include some advice on how to localize the Windows deployment, as it's something that users outside of the US appear to struggle with (judging by many forum posts).

If a paragraph could be created that includes examples of extra 'Rules' for localization, that would be a great time saver for your readers.  In my instance (for Australia) I needed to add the following lines, but it took a few hours of testing to find the correct parameters, and where to set them!

UserLocale=en-AU
SystemLocale=en-AU
InputLocale=0c09:00000409
KeyboardLocale=0c09:00000409

Thanks,

Trevor.
