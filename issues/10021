FAQ states:
"Hybrid customers can on-board their Azure tenant to use the Windows Hello for Business PIN reset service to reset their PINs without access to their corporate network."
In an internal discussion this statement was denied:
"On-prem connectivity is needed for Hybrid joined PCs"

There is other public documentation stating that DC connectivity is required:
"For hybrid Azure AD joined devices, users must have corporate network connectivity to domain controllers to reset their PIN."
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-feature-pin-reset#using-pin-reset

I tried to get it running in a lab but as soon as my DC is unavailable, PIN reset fails (error code: 0x80090033). Can you please verify this statement or remove it?
