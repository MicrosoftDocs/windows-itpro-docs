I am getting error 0x80072f8f.  What does it mean?

g:\os\src>err 0x80072f8f
# for hex 0x80072f8f / decimal -2147012721
  WININET_E_DECODING_FAILED                                      winerror.h
# Content decoding has failed

Looking through the source code, it looks like it is maybe related to HTTPS requests, maybe something to do with the certificates or maybe compression.  Not sure.
