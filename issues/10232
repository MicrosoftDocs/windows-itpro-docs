I copied and pasted the mdmdiagnosticstool command exactly as it is on the support page listed and it returns an error; "Autopilot : The term 'Autopilot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again."

Same for DeviceProvisioning.

I definitely have both in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MdmDiagnostics\Area

I tried re-ordering the areas in your command and it seems that it no longer respects/allows/works with the ; separator. That is, if Autopilot is first, then I don't get an error about Autopilot, but do about the other two. DeviceProvisioning also works when it is the first item in the list. So, it seems the ; separator doesn't work now. 

Can you please clarify and update?
