The `tags` preference is listed as a dictionary and has associated keys `key` and `value`.  While these contained keys are listed as string values, it is uncertain whether these preferences are supposed to be able to be listed multiple times, similar to the `exclusions` preference, or only once.  While the `exclusions` preference is listed as a dictionary in the documentation, the example profile has `exclusions` as an array with contained dictionaries.

Because the `tags` preference is not listed in the full config profile example, it is unclear as to the required format for the profile.

Can the `tags` preference be added to the config profile example?
