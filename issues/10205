Microsoft Deployment Toolkit can no longer be used if your organization relied on out-of-the-box digital licensing.

In the past, MDT could import an image from Media Creation Tool, provided you exported the licensed Windows Edition from install.esd using DISM to an install.wim source file.

This year, the above process displays the error message "the source directory does not contain an identifiable operating system."

Our organization had not purchased Windows 10 Pro volume licensing, as the various manufacturers already provided digital licensing.  Each year we deploy a clean and tested customized image via MDT containing the latest security patches and organization-specific configurations.

Now that MDT requires a volume license or physical media image natively containing install.wim source file, we have to revisist our deployment strategy, with very short notice.

Given there has been no change to our MDT environment, aside of regular updates, I suspect a change in the Media Creation Tool ISO now prevents the detection of an OS.
