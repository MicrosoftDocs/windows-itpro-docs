It needs to be clearly noted that Windows Hello For Business Multi-Factor Authentication requirement can be fulfilled by using ADFS Certificate Authentication. It is very misleading for users attempting to grasp this complicated implementation when the docs do not have all the available information present. This is especially true for those of us attempting a 100% on-prem configuration and being pushed towards Azure MFA.
