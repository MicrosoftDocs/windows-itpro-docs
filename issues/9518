This article has a 'Note' section containing the text:


`AppLocker is a defense-in-depth security feature and not a security boundary. Windows Defender Application Control should be used when the goal is to provide robust protection against a threat and there are expected to be no by-design limitations that would prevent the security feature from achieving this goal.`


"not a security boundary" and "Windows Defender Application Control" are both hyperlinks out to the very helpful Microsoft defintion of a security boundary, but I think the intent may have been for that second link to provide the reader with a quick way to find further reading about WDAC, possibly via something like [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/wdac-and-applocker-overview)?
