This article provides details about what GP setting to make to enable various levels of auditingcceptance for NTLM auth, but makes no recommendation about specifically where the policy should be applied. Should it be applied only against DC's in the default DC policy? Against all domain computers? More information is needed to effectively deploy this security measure.
