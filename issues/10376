Hello,

I'm trying to install an application using the .msi file and a MsiInstallJob XML file.

However, the installation fails because the .msi contains fields that needs to be filled (credential fields). Is there a way to add, inside the XML file, the value to use inside those fields?

Kind regards,
Alexandre
