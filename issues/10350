"Type the path to the program in the text box. Use environment variables as appropriate to ensure that programs installed in different locations on different computers work correctly."

Env variables can be system or user defined, built-in to Windows or custom/user defined. From testing, it appears that custom variables are unsupported, i.e. they fail (via GPO, UX, or MDM). 

Please detail what env variables are supported so that it can be understood which are not.
