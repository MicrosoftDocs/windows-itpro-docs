Hello Guys , 

this procedure doesn't takes you anywhere  : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-hybrid-cert-trust-devreg#create-service-connection-point-scp-in-active-directory because 

the adsyncPrem.psm1 was removed starting AD Connect 2.0 , so is not clear how to enable hybrid cert trust deployment.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-version-history#release-status-11

"We removed the ADSyncPrep.psm1 module from the installation because it's no longer used." (ad connect release note) 

This doc must be updated : I suspect that the ADFS registration services was de facto deprecated and is not today possible or recommended to achive cert trust with ADFS. 

Thanks in advance
