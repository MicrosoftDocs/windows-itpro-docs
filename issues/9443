There is a lot of unclarity here 
==> For the OnPrem PIN Reset
1. Screenshots are missing for the user experience
2. How long does it take after the PIN reset until fingerprint and PIN can be reused to sign-in - after our tests there is a delay (about 30 minutes). It is unclear what is the issue for the delay (domain controller replication, azure replication, ADFS etc.???)
3. In Certificate Trust -> What needs to be done to get the user certificate (smartcard EKU) back?

==>Azure PIN reset
1. Can AzurePIN reset used even when the client / user was initially enrolled without the Group Policy set?
2. Screenshots are missing for the user experience
3. How does the AzurePIN reset work technically? Are there any delays expected? Does it work with Certificate trust?
4. Is the SSRP feature necessary for AzurePIN reset and how should it be configured?
