## Summary

Some of the provisioning package articles are out of date. For example, the user flow in [Apply a provisioning package](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-apply-package) is based on EOL versions of Windows 10, I think I even see a screenshot of the settings page that is pre fluent design (before build 1803).

I use provisioning packages regularly and would love for some of these outdated pages to be updated. I would also be thrilled to contribute to these pages.
