I have tried any possible variation of the explained solution, to no avail. Finally, I was able to configure the upgradeEditionWithProductKey using **Devices > Windows > Configuration Profiles > Create Profile** and selecting **Templates > Edition Upgrade and mode switch**

Maybe this alternative should be mentioned as I spent multiple days looking for a way to upgrade all licenses to Windows Enterprise for InTune using this guide.
