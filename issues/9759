Vulnerability
The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient. Members of the local Administrators group have this right by default.

This paragraph does not really describe the potential vulnerability and how it can be exploited. Does the scheduled task need to exist with this user account before someone can logon as a batch job or is the right sufficient?
