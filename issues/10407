Hi team, this page on subscription upgrades to Windows only covers upgrades to Windows Enterprise via M365 enterprise licenses (ie E3/E5) - however upgrade to Windows Business via M365 Business licenses (ie M365 Business Premium) is also possible too. Can we add that info to this page, or make it obvious this page only relates to the enterprise licensing and create a similar page for the Business subscription upgrades? Cheers!
