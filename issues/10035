The "Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers" looks similar to "Enterprise Domain Controllers", which is documented as a Special Identity in this page.

Contrary to other special identities, "Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers" exist as an AD group in the "Users" container and we can see its member. However, even when RODC are present in the forest it stays empty:

But, when a security token is created for an RODC, it automatically contains "Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers":

So it isn't really like other special identities, but it behaves like one.
Shouldn't it be documented in this special identities page?
Another option would be to describe this in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups with the same "Membership is controlled by the operating system" sentence.
