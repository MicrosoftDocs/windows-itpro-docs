Looks like step "Apply Windows PE (BCD)" does not work after sysprep - VM restarts to current system without booting WinPE (Hyper-V VM hosted by Windows Server 2016)

As workaround I extracted from LTISysprep script to commit pending renames, and put them in following way:
1. Commit pending renames
2. Apply Windows PE (BCD)
3. Sysprep

This way OS being captured correctly.

But it would be nice to have supported solution.
