In the section "**_Create an NDES-Intune authentication certificate template_**" point no 8. In order for computers/servers to show in "_Enter the object names to select_" with an underline, the checkbox in "_Select this object type_" for "Computers" needs to be checked.
Unless point no 8 refers to, user account and not a computer object but it doesn't look like it.
Kind regards,
Mikael
