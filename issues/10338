This note is misleading:

It specifically states when a 'Hybrid Certificate trust is performed'. This may be the case for the 'known PRT issue', however, in a 100% on-prem configuration, WHFB will NOT attempt to provision on client endpoints unless this workaround is implemented. The ADFS Admin event logs stated in the note do not show up, however, provisioning will not happen until this workaround is implemented.
