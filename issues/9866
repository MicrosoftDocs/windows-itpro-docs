Hi,

We finally have computers talking back to our work space and showing all the information about the machines but none are reporting back with computer names.

The settings we're currently pushing out via gpo are below

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection
AllowDeviceNameInTelemetry (Dword) = 1 (1)
AllowTelemetry (Dword) = 1 (1)
AllowUpdateComplianceProcessing (Dword) = 10 (16)
AllowWUfBCloudProcessing (Dword) = 8 (8)
CommercialID (Reg_SZ) = 'Our commercial ID'
DisableTelemetryOptInSettingsUx (Dword) = 1 (1)

We have the commercial ID correct and data is feeding back but the machine name just isn't being populated.
We either have nothing or just #
Is there anything else we need to change or anything that can be done to force the machine names to be populated?
Has anyone seen this when activly defining to allow device name in telemetry?

Cheers
