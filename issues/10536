What in the world is this encyclopia of a dictionary?  Could someone please simplify this trash?  We don't need a PhD here.  We need an automated solution that will TEST for some of these conditions before we waste our time?  I don't see any steps that test to see if any of these things are done already in an environment.  And you all wonder why support tickets are extreme...
