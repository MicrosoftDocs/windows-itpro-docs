According to article, Azure AD registered device are supported:

> Your local PC (where you're connecting from) must be ... [Azure AD registered](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-register) if using Windows 10, version 2004 and above. Remote connections to an Azure AD-joined PC from an unjoined device or a non-Windows 10 device aren't supported.

But then it goes on to say:

> The local PC and remote PC must be in the same Azure AD tenant. 

A device can be registered to multiple tenants. What does "in" mean in this context? Does the device have to be registered to only one tenant? Is it the first tenant?
