The Windows Fido2 documentation is terrible compared to the original  FIDO2 documentation. Instead of providing access to a better API and compete on quality, there is enforcement to use this underdocumented API. Unfortunately the MS api does not seem to be a one to one translation.

At least it would be fair that microsoft explains that they block unelevated access to the CTAP API of the Hardware. 

Further Microsoft should provide a migration guide from CTAP to webauthn.h for developers.
