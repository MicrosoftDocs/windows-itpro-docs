Tab
When viewing the table "Supported Windows 10 downgrade paths" the lack of cell outlines and the use of a blank cell to positively identify an outcome makes the table very hard to read.
Please update the table "Supported Windows 10 downgrade paths" to positively identify the situation for all scenarios:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-edition-upgrades#supported-windows-10-downgrade-paths

✔ = Supported downgrade path
❌ = Not supported
NA = Not considered a downgrade or an upgrade

[blank] = Not supported or not a downgrade
