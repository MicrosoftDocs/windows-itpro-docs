Our tests show that non-administrators don't receive any of the notifications in this document, even though the deadline settins themselves work. However, if I log in with an account that has local admin privilegies, the notifications are shown. We have set the GPO that should allow non-administrators to receive update notifications, but I suspect that GPO doesn't apply to Windows 10, as it's not  listed as a supported OS for that setting.

The question is: How do we notify non-administrator users on the machines that have update deadlines set? Is it at all possible?
