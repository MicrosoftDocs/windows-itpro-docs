Hi,

Just wondering if there is any thoughts on including a section that refers to the intune\mem equivalent. This would add people who are moving away from GPO's as a configuration plane and towards Intune\MEM with Autopilot to manage their fleet. 

If the the setting is configurable via one of the inbuilt templates just refer to that, or as is the case here call out that a CSP or alternate method should be used for deploying this setting.

Regards
John
