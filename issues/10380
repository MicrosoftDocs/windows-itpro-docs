The info doesn't mention if Credential Guard can be used together with Remote Credential Guard.

Should it be possible to use Credential Guard on a local host while using Remote Credential Guard to connect to a remote server? The connection seem to succeed but when opening a file share on the remote server, it seems impossible to retrieve a Kerberos ticket via the local host.
