I'm sitting on the phone with a bank that wants to use this product and we've had four or five calls talking about data handling.... they want to have this data in very clear terms. 

_"file data (such as file names, sizes, and hashes)"?_ 
does that mean the files will be collected? 
_"process data (running processes, hashes)"_
does this mean the process memory? 

This kind of stuff has to be very specific.
