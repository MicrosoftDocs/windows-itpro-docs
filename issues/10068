Hi,

I have AGMP successfully running on a Windows Server 2016 member server in a pre-prod environment. After reviewing the supported server operating system lists I have noticed Windows Server 2016 is not listed as a supported OS to run AGPM 4.3 on! This is odd as 2019 and 2012 are both listed as being supported. I do think this is a typo, but can someone please clarify that 2016 is a supported OS for AGPM 4.3, before I deploy this into a production environment?
