Hello,

I don't think that "Azure Rights Management" is good here, as far I know Azure Rights Management has been replaced by Unified Labeling isn't it?

And hyperlink is broken "Use Azure RMS for WIP. Determines whether WIP uses **Microsoft Azure Rights Management**"
Here I guess it should point to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-azure-rms

So could be good to update the link and maybe to replace the naming? As possibly no longer possible to deploy Azure Rights Management or Azure Information Protection, only the Office 365 Unified Labeling.
