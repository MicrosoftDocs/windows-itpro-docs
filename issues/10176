According to the description in the documentation** of event 4688 A new process has been created - TokenElevationTypeDefault (1): Type 1 is a full token with no privileges removed or groups disabled. A full token is only used if User Account Control is disabled or if the user is the built-in Administrator account (for which UAC disabled by default), service account or local system account.

However in reality (Windows 7, Windows 10) when a regular user (who is ONLY a member of the users group) starts a process then events 4688 with TokenElevationTypeDefault (1) are generated. The UAC is enabled and the user is not an built-in Administrator or even a member of the local Administrators group.

Question: how this could happen - an ordinary regular user cannot have a full token. This description of the event in the documentation does not allow to properly analyze incidents related to this event and to make cyber investigations.
