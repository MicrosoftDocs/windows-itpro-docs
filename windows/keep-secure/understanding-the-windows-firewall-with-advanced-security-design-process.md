-   [Evaluating Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Design Examples](evaluating-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design-examples.md)

After you identify your deployment goals and map them to a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security design, you can begin documenting the design based on the processes that are described in the following topics:
