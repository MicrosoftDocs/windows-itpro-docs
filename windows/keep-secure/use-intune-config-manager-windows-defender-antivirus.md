# Use System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune to configure and manage Windows Defender AV

If you are using System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Intune to manage the endpoints on your network, you can also use them to manage Windows Defender AV.

In both cases, the protection will be labelled as Endpoint Protection, although the engine is the same as that used by Windows Defender AV.

See the [Endpoint Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection) library on docs.microsoft.com for information on using Configuration Manager.

For Microsoft Intune, consult the [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune).
