# Use the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection portal

- Windows 10 Insider Preview

<span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>

A typical security breach investigation requires a member of a security operations team to:

1. View an alert on the **Dashboard** or **Alerts queue**
2. Review the indicators of compromise (IOC) or indications of attack (IOAs)
3. Review a timeline of alerts, behaviors, and events from the machine
4. Manage alerts, understand the threat or potential breach, collect information to support taking action, and resolve the alert

Security operation teams can use Windows Defender ATP Portal to carry out this end-to-end process without having to leave the portal.
Teams can monitor the overall status of enterprise endpoints from the **Dashboard**, gain insight on the various alerts, their category, when they were observed, and how long they’ve been in the network at a glance.

[Investigate machines](machines-view-windows-advanced-threat-protection.md) | The **Machines view** shows a list of the machines in your network, the corresponding number of active alerts for each machine categorized by alert severity levels, as well as the number of threats.
[Submit files to the Deep analysis feature](deep-analysis-windows-advanced-threat-protection.md) | You can submit files for deep analysis to see detailed information about the file’s activities, observed behaviors, and associated artifacts (such as dropped files, registry modifications, and communications with IPs).
