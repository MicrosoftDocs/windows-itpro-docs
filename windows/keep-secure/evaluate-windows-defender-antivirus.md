# Evaluate Windows Defender Antivirus protection


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1703

**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


If you're an enterprise security administrator, and you want to determine how well Windows Defender Antivirus protects you from viruses, malware, and potentially unwanted applications, then you can use this guide to help you evaluate Microsoft protection.

It explains the important features available for both small and large enterprises in Windows Defender, and how they will increase malware detection and protection across your network.

You can choose to configure and evaluate each setting independently, or all at once. We have grouped similar settings based upon typical evaluation scenarios, and include instructions for using PowerShell to enable the settings.

The guide is available in PDF format for offline viewing:

You can also download a PowerShell that will enable all the settings described in the guide automatically. You can obtain the script alongside the PDF download above, or individually from PowerShell Gallery:
