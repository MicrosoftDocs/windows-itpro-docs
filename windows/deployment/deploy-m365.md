# Deploy Windows with Microsoft 365

This article provides a brief overview of Microsoft 365 and describes how to use a free 90-day trial account to review some of the benefits of Microsoft 365.

[Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) is an offering from Microsoft that combines [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/features) with [Office 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/office-365), and [Enterprise Mobility and Security](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business) (EMS). See the [Microsoft 365 Enterprise poster](#microsoft-365-enterprise-poster) for an overview.

For Windows deployment, Microsoft 365 includes a deployment advisor that walks through the entire process of deploying Windows. The wizard supports multiple Windows deployment methods, including:

- Windows Autopilot.
- In-place upgrade.
- Deploying Windows upgrade with Intune.
- Deploying Windows upgrade with Microsoft Configuration Manager.
- Deploying a computer refresh with Microsoft Configuration Manager.

## Free trial account

If an existing Microsoft services subscription account exists, and there's access to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

1. Sign into the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
1. Go to **Billing** and then **Purchase services**.
1. In the Enterprise Suites section of the service offerings, find the Microsoft 365 E3 and Microsoft 365 E5 tiles.
1. Select one of the available **Start Free Trial** options.

If there isn't an existing Microsoft services subscription, Microsoft 365 deployment advisor and other resources can be tried for free! Just follow these steps:

1. [Obtain a free Microsoft 365 trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try).
1. Check out the [Microsoft 365 deployment advisor](https://aka.ms/microsoft365setupguide).

> [!NOTE]
>
> When setup guide runs for the first time, the **Prepare your environment** guide appears. This guide makes sure the basics are covered like domain verification and a method for adding users. At the end of the **Prepare your environment** guide, there's a **Ready to continue** button that goes back to the original guide that was selected.
