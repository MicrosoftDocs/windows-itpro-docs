# User State Migration Tool (USMT) overview articles

The User State Migration Tool (USMT) provides a highly customizable user-profile migration experience for IT professionals. USMT includes three command-line tools: `ScanState.exe`, `LoadState.exe`, and `UsmtUtils.exe`. USMT also includes a set of three modifiable .xml files: `MigApp.xml`, `MigDocs.xml`, and `MigUser.xml`. Additionally, custom **.xml** files can be created to support the organization's migration needs. A `Config.xml` file can also be created to specify files or settings to exclude from the migration.
