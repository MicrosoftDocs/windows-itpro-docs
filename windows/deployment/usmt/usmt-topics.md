# User State Migration Tool (USMT) overview topics

The User State Migration Tool (USMT) 10.0 provides a highly customizable user-profile migration experience for IT professionals. USMT includes three command-line tools: `ScanState.exe`, `LoadState.exe`, and `UsmtUtils.exe`. USMT also includes a set of three modifiable .xml files: `MigApp.xml`, `MigDocs.xml`, and `MigUser.xml`. Additionally, you can create custom .xml files to support your migration needs. You can also create a `Config.xml` file to specify files or settings to exclude from the migration.
