# Recognized environment variables

When using the XML files `MigDocs.xml`, `MigApp.xml`, and `MigUser.xml`, you can use environment variables to identify folders that may be different on different computers. Constant special item ID list (CSIDL) values provide a way to identify folders that applications use frequently but may not have the same name or location on any given computer. For example, the **Documents** folder may be `C:\Users\<Username>\My Documents` on one computer and `C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents` on another. You can use the asterisk (\*) wildcard character in `MigUser.xml`, `MigApp.xml` and `MigDoc.xml` files. However, you can't use the asterisk (\*) wildcard characters in the `Config.xml` file.

## Variables that are processed for the operating system and in the context of each user

You can use these variables within sections in the .xml files with `context=UserAndSystem`, `context=User`, and `context=System`.
