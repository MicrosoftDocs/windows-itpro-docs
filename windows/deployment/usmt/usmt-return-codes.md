# Return codes

This article describes User State Migration Tool (USMT) 10.0 return codes and error messages. Also included is a table listing the USMT return codes with their associated mitigation steps. In addition, this article provides tips to help you use the logfiles to determine why you received an error.

Understanding the requirements for running USMT can help minimize errors in your USMT migrations. For more information, see [USMT Requirements](usmt-requirements.md).

## USMT return codes

If you encounter an error in your USMT migration, you can use return codes and the more specific information provided in the associated USMT error messages to troubleshoot the issue and to identify mitigation steps.

Return codes are grouped into the following broad categories that describe their area of error reporting:

- Success or User Cancel

- Invalid Command Lines

- Setup and Initialization

- Non-fatal Errors

- Fatal Errors

As a best practice, we recommend that you set verbosity level to 5, `v:5`, on the `ScanState.exe`, `LoadState.exe`, and `UsmtUtils.exe` command lines so that the most detailed reporting is available in the respective USMT logs. You can use a higher verbosity level if you want the log files output to go to a debugger.

## USMT error messages

Error messages provide more detailed information about the migration problem than the associated return code. For example, the **ScanState**, **LoadState**, or **UsmtUtils** tool might return a code of **11** (for **USMT_INVALID_PARAMETERS**) and a related error message that reads **/key and /keyfile both specified**. The error message is displayed at the command prompt and is identified in the **ScanState**, **LoadState**, or **UsmtUtils** log files to help you determine why the return code was received.

You can obtain more information about any listed **Windows** system error codes by typing in a command prompt window `net.exe helpmsg <error_number>`  where *<error_number>* is the error code number generated by the error message. For more information about System Error Codes, see [System Error Codes (0-499)](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--0-499-).
