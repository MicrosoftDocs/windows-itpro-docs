# User State Migration Tool (USMT) technical reference

The User State Migration Tool (USMT) is included with the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) for Windows 10. USMT provides a highly customizable user-profile migration experience for IT professionals.

Download the Windows ADK [from this website](/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install).

## USMT support for Microsoft Office

- USMT in the Windows ADK for Windows 10, version 1511 (10.1.10586.0) supports migration of user settings for installations of Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013.

- USMT in the Windows ADK for Windows 10, version 1607 (10.1.14393.0) adds support for migration of user settings for installations of Microsoft Office 2016.

USMT includes three command-line tools:

- ScanState.exe
- LoadState.exe
- UsmtUtils.exe

USMT also includes a set of three modifiable .xml files:

- MigApp.xml
- MigDocs.xml
- MigUser.xml

Additionally, you can create custom .xml files to support your migration needs. You can also create a `Config.xml` file to specify files or settings to exclude from the migration.

USMT tools can be used on several versions of Windows operating systems, for more information, see [USMT requirements](usmt-requirements.md). For more information about previous releases of the USMT tools, see [User State Migration Tool (USMT) overview](/previous-versions/windows/hh825227(v=win.10)).
