# Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using Configuration Manager

*Applies to*

- Windows 10

> [!Important]
> This guide uses the proof of concept (PoC) environment, and some settings that are configured in the following guides:
>
> - [Step by step guide: Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab](windows-10-poc.md)
> - [Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](windows-10-poc-mdt.md)
>
> Complete all steps in these guides before you start the procedures in this guide. If you want to skip the Windows 10 deployment procedures in the MDT guide, and move directly to this guide, at least install MDT and the Windows ADK before starting this guide. All steps in the first guide are required before attempting the procedures in this guide.

The PoC environment is a virtual network running on Hyper-V with three virtual machines (VMs):

- **DC1**: A contoso.com domain controller, DNS server, and DHCP server.
- **SRV1**: A dual-homed contoso.com domain member server, DNS server, and default gateway providing NAT service for the PoC network.
- **PC1**: A contoso.com member computer running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 that has been cloned from a physical computer on your network for testing purposes.

This guide uses the Hyper-V server role to perform procedures. If you don't complete all steps in a single session, consider using [checkpoints](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn818483(v=ws.11)) and [saved states](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee247418(v=ws.10)) to pause, resume, or restart your work.

Multiple features and services are installed on SRV1 in this guide. This configuration isn't a typical installation, and is only done to set up a lab environment with a bare minimum of resources. However, if less than 4 GB of RAM is allocated to SRV1 in the Hyper-V console, some procedures will be slow to complete. If resources are limited on the Hyper-V host, consider reducing RAM allocation on DC1 and PC1, and then increasing the RAM allocation on SRV1. You can adjust RAM allocation for a VM by right-clicking the VM in the Hyper-V Manager console, select **Settings**, select **Memory**, and modify the value next to **Maximum RAM**.

## In this guide

This guide provides end-to-end instructions to install and configure Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, and use it to deploy a Windows 10 image. Depending on the speed of your Hyper-V host, the procedures in this guide will require 6-10 hours to complete.

The procedures in this guide are summarized in the following table. An estimate of the time required to complete each procedure is also provided. Time required to complete procedures will vary depending on the resources available to the Hyper-V host and assigned to VMs, such as processor speed, memory allocation, disk speed, and network speed.

## Install prerequisites

1. Before installing Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, we must install prerequisite services and features. Type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on SRV1:

    ```powershell
    Install-WindowsFeature Web-Windows-Auth,Web-ISAPI-Ext,Web-Metabase,Web-WMI,BITS,RDC,NET-Framework-Features,Web-Asp-Net,Web-Asp-Net45,NET-HTTP-Activation,NET-Non-HTTP-Activ
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the request to add features fails, retry the installation by typing the command again.

2. Download [SQL Server 2014 SP2](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2014-sp2) from the Microsoft Evaluation Center as an .ISO file on the Hyper-V host computer. Save the file to the **C:\VHD** directory.
3. When you've downloaded the file **SQLServer2014SP2-FullSlipstream-x64-ENU.iso** and placed it in the C:\VHD directory, type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host:

    ```powershell
    Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName SRV1 -Path c:\VHD\SQLServer2014SP2-FullSlipstream-x64-ENU.iso
    ```

    This command mounts the .ISO file to drive D on SRV1.

4. Type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on SRV1 to install SQL Server:

    ```powershell
    D:\setup.exe /q /ACTION=Install /ERRORREPORTING="False" /FEATURES=SQLENGINE,RS,IS,SSMS,TOOLS,ADV_SSMS,CONN /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER /INSTANCEDIR="C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server" /SQLSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\System" /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS="BUILTIN\ADMINISTRATORS" /SQLSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Automatic /AGTSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" /AGTSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Automatic /RSSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\System" /RSSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Automatic /ISSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\System" /ISSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Disabled /ASCOLLATION="Latin1_General_CI_AS" /SQLCOLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" /TCPENABLED="1" /NPENABLED="1" /IAcceptSQLServerLicenseTerms
    ```

    Installation will take several minutes. When installation is complete, the following output will be displayed:

    abortpxe.com
    bootmgfw.efi
    bootmgr.exe
    pxeboot.com
    pxeboot.n12
    wdsmgfw.efi
    wdsnbp.com
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If these files aren't present in the C:\RemoteInstall directory, verify that the REMINST share is configured as C:\RemoteInstall. You can view the properties of this share by typing `net share REMINST` at a command prompt. If the share path is set to a different value, then replace C:\RemoteInstall with your REMINST share path.
    >
    > You can also type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt to open the CMTrace. In the tool, select **File**, select **Open**, and then open the **distmgr.log** file. If errors are present, they will be highlighted in red:

6. On the Customization page, select the **Use a custom background bitmap file** checkbox, and under **UNC path**, type or browse to **\\\SRV1\Sources$\OSD\Branding\contoso.bmp**, and then select **Next** twice. It will take a few minutes to generate the boot image.
7. Select **Finish**.
8. In the console display pane, right-click the **Zero Touch WinPE x64** boot image, and then select **Distribute Content**.
9. In the Distribute Content Wizard, select **Next**, select **Add** and select **Distribution Point**, select the **SRV1.CONTOSO.COM** checkbox, select **OK**, select **Next** twice, and then select **Close**.
10. Use the CMTrace application to view the **distmgr.log** file again and verify that the boot image has been distributed. To open CMTrace, type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on SRV1:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-Item 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\tools\cmtrace.exe'
    ```

    In the trace tool, select **Tools** on the menu and choose **Find**. Search for "**STATMSG: ID=2301**". For example:

    ```console
    STATMSG: ID=2301 SEV=I LEV=M SOURCE="SMS Server" COMP="SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER" SYS=SRV1.CONTOSO.COM SITE=PS1 PID=924 TID=1424 GMTDATE=Tue Oct 09 22:36:30.986 2018 ISTR0="Zero Touch WinPE x64" ISTR1="PS10000A" ISTR2="" ISTR3="" ISTR4="" ISTR5="" ISTR6="" ISTR7="" ISTR8="" ISTR9="" NUMATTRS=1 AID0=400 AVAL0="PS10000A"    SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER    10/9/2018 3:36:30 PM    1424 (0x0590)
    ```

11. You can also review status by clicking the **Zero Touch WinPE x64** image, and then clicking **Content Status** under **Related Objects** in the bottom right-hand corner of the console, or by entering **\Monitoring\Overview\Distribution Status\Content Status** on the location bar in the console. Double-click **Zero Touch WinPE x64** under **Content Status** in the console tree and verify that a status of **Successfully distributed content** is displayed on the **Success** tab.
12. Next, in the **Software Library** workspace, double-click **Zero Touch WinPE x64** and then select the **Data Source** tab.
13. Select the **Deploy this boot image from the PXE-enabled distribution point** checkbox, and select **OK**.
14. Review the distmgr.log file again for "**STATMSG: ID=2301**" and verify that there are three folders under **C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages** with boot images. See the following example:

    ```console
    cmd /c dir /s /b C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages

    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100004
    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100005
    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100006
    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100004\boot.PS100004.wim
    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100005\boot.PS100005.wim
    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100006\WinPE.PS100006.wim
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The first two images (`*.wim` files) are default boot images. The third is the new boot image with DaRT.

### Create a Windows 10 reference image

If you've already completed steps in [Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](windows-10-poc-mdt.md) then you've already created a Windows 10 reference image. In this case, skip to the next procedure in this guide: [Add a Windows 10 OS image](#add-a-windows-10-os-image). If you've not yet created a Windows 10 reference image, complete the steps in this section.

1. In [Step by step guide: Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab](windows-10-poc.md) the Windows 10 Enterprise .iso file was saved to the c:\VHD directory as **c:\VHD\w10-enterprise.iso**. The first step in creating a deployment share is to mount this file on SRV1.  To mount the Windows 10 Enterprise DVD on SRV1, open an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host computer and type the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName SRV1 -Path c:\VHD\w10-enterprise.iso
    ```

1. Verify that the Windows Enterprise installation DVD is mounted on SRV1 as drive letter D.

1. The Windows 10 Enterprise installation files will be used to create a deployment share on SRV1 using the MDT deployment workbench. To open the deployment workbench, select **Start**, type **deployment**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

1. In the Deployment Workbench console, right-click **Deployment Shares** and select **New Deployment Share**.

1. Use the following settings for the New Deployment Share Wizard:
    - Deployment share path: **C:\MDTBuildLab**
    - Share name: **MDTBuildLab$**
    - Deployment share description: **MDT build lab**
    - Options: Select **Next** to accept the default
    - Summary: Select **Next**
    - Progress: settings will be applied
    - Confirmation: Select **Finish**

1. Expand the **Deployment Shares** node, and then expand **MDT build lab**.

1. Right-click the **Operating Systems** node, and then select **New Folder**. Name the new folder **Windows 10**. Complete the wizard using default values and select **Finish**.

1. Right-click the **Windows 10** folder created in the previous step, and then select **Import Operating System**.

1. Use the following settings for the Import Operating System Wizard:
    - OS Type: **Full set of source files**
    - Source: **D:\\**
    - Destination: **W10Ent_x64**
    - Summary: Select **Next**
    - Confirmation: Select **Finish**

1. For purposes of this test lab, we won't add applications, such as Microsoft Office, to the deployment share. For more information about adding applications, see [Add applications](deploy-windows-mdt/create-a-windows-10-reference-image.md#add-applications).

1. The next step is to create a task sequence to reference the OS that was imported. To create a task sequence, right-click the **Task Sequences** node under **MDT Build Lab** and then select **New Task Sequence**. Use the following settings for the New Task Sequence Wizard:
    - Task sequence ID: **REFW10X64-001**
    - Task sequence name: **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Default Image**
    - Task sequence comments: **Reference Build**
    - Template: **Standard Client Task Sequence**
    - Select OS: Select **Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation in W10Ent_x64 install.wim**
    - Specify Product Key: **Do not specify a product key at this time**
    - Full Name: **Contoso**
    - Organization: **Contoso**
    - Internet Explorer home page: **http://www.contoso.com**
    - Admin Password: **Do not specify an Administrator password at this time**
    - Summary: Select **Next**
    - Confirmation: Select **Finish**

1. Edit the task sequence to add the Microsoft NET Framework 3.5, which is required by many applications. To edit the task sequence, double-click **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Default Image** that was created in the previous step.

1. Select the **Task Sequence** tab. Under **State Restore**, select **Tattoo** to highlight it, then select **Add** and choose **New Group**. A new group will be added under Tattoo.

1. On the Properties tab of the group that was created in the previous step, change the Name from New Group to **Custom Tasks (Pre-Windows Update)** and then select **Apply**. To see the name change, select **Tattoo**, then select the new group again.

1. Select the **Custom Tasks (Pre-Windows Update)** group again, select **Add**, point to **Roles**, and then select **Install Roles and Features**.

1. Under **Select the roles and features that should be installed**, select **.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)** and then select **Apply**.

1. Enable Windows Update in the task sequence by clicking the **Windows Update (Post-Application Installation)** step, clicking the **Options** tab, and clearing the **Disable this step** checkbox.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Since we aren't installing applications in this test lab, there's no need to enable the Windows Update Pre-Application Installation step. However, you should enable this step if you're also installing applications.

1. Select **OK** to complete editing the task sequence.

1. The next step is to configure the MDT deployment share rules. To configure rules in the Deployment Workbench, right-click MDT build lab (C:\MDTBuildLab) and select **Properties**, and then select the **Rules** tab.

1. Replace the default rules with the following text:

    ```ini
    [Settings]
    Priority=Default

    [Default]
    _SMSTSORGNAME=Contoso
    UserDataLocation=NONE
    DoCapture=YES
    OSInstall=Y
    AdminPassword=pass@word1
    TimeZoneName=Pacific Standard TimeZoneName
    OSDComputername=#Left("PC-%SerialNumber%",7)#
    JoinWorkgroup=WORKGROUP
    HideShell=YES
    FinishAction=SHUTDOWN
    DoNotCreateExtraPartition=YES
    ApplyGPOPack=NO
    SkipAdminPassword=YES
    SkipProductKey=YES
    SkipComputerName=YES
    SkipDomainMembership=YES
    SkipUserData=YES
    SkipLocaleSelection=YES
    SkipTaskSequence=NO
    SkipTimeZone=YES
    SkipApplications=YES
    SkipBitLocker=YES
    SkipSummary=YES
    SkipRoles=YES
    SkipCapture=NO
    SkipFinalSummary=NO
    ```

1. Select **Apply** and then select **Edit Bootstrap.ini**. Replace the contents of the Bootstrap.ini file with the following text, and save the file:

    ```ini
    [Settings]
    Priority=Default

    [Default]
    DeployRoot=\\SRV1\MDTBuildLab$
    UserDomain=CONTOSO
    UserID=MDT_BA
    UserPassword=pass@word1
    SkipBDDWelcome=YES
    ```

1. Select **OK** to complete the configuration of the deployment share.

1. Right-click **MDT build lab (C:\MDTBuildLab)** and then select **Update Deployment Share**.

1. Accept all default values in the Update Deployment Share Wizard by clicking **Next**.  The update process will take 5 to 10 minutes. When it has completed, select **Finish**.

1. Copy **c:\MDTBuildLab\Boot\LiteTouchPE_x86.iso** on SRV1 to the **c:\VHD** directory on the Hyper-V host computer. In MDT, the x86 boot image can deploy both x86 and x64 operating systems, except on computers based on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).

    > [!TIP]
    > To copy the file, right-click the **LiteTouchPE_x86.iso** file, and select **Copy** on SRV1. Then open the **c:\VHD** folder on the Hyper-V host, right-click inside the folder, and select **Paste**.

1. Open a Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host computer and type the following commands:

    ```powershell
    New-VM -Name REFW10X64-001 -SwitchName poc-internal -NewVHDPath "c:\VHD\REFW10X64-001.vhdx" -NewVHDSizeBytes 60GB
    Set-VMMemory -VMName REFW10X64-001 -DynamicMemoryEnabled $true -MinimumBytes 1024MB -MaximumBytes 1024MB -Buffer 20
    Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName REFW10X64-001 -Path c:\VHD\LiteTouchPE_x86.iso
    Start-VM REFW10X64-001
    vmconnect localhost REFW10X64-001
    ```

1. In the Windows Deployment Wizard, select **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Default Image**, and then select **Next**.

1. Accept the default values on the Capture Image page, and select **Next**. OS installation will complete after 5 to 10 minutes and then the VM will reboot automatically. Allow the system to boot normally, don't press a key. The process is fully automated.

    Other system restarts will occur to complete updating and preparing the OS. Setup will complete the following procedures:

    - Install the Windows 10 Enterprise OS.
    - Install added applications, roles, and features.
    - Update the OS using Windows Update (or WSUS if optionally specified).
    - Stage Windows PE on the local disk.
    - Run System Preparation (Sysprep) and reboot into Windows PE.
    - Capture the installation to a Windows Imaging (WIM) file.
    - Turn off the virtual machine.

    This step requires from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the speed of the Hyper-V host and your network's download speed. After some time, you'll have a Windows 10 Enterprise x64 image that is fully patched and has run through Sysprep. The image is located in the C:\MDTBuildLab\Captures folder on SRV1. The file name is **REFW10X64-001.wim**.

### Add a Windows 10 OS image

1. Type the following commands at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on SRV1:

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Sources\OSD\OS\Windows 10 Enterprise x64"
    cmd /c copy /z "C:\MDTBuildLab\Captures\REFW10X64-001.wim" "C:\Sources\OSD\OS\Windows 10 Enterprise x64"
    ```

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, right-click **Operating System Images**, and then select **Add Operating System Image**.

5. Select **Close**.

## Deploy Windows 10 using PXE and Configuration Manager

In this first deployment scenario, you'll deploy Windows 10 using PXE. This scenario creates a new computer that doesn't have any migrated users or settings.

1. Type the following commands at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host:

    ```powershell
    New-VM -Name "PC4" -NewVHDPath "c:\vhd\pc4.vhdx" -NewVHDSizeBytes 40GB -SwitchName poc-internal -BootDevice NetworkAdapter -Generation 2
    Set-VMMemory -VMName "PC4" -DynamicMemoryEnabled $true -MinimumBytes 512MB -MaximumBytes 2048MB -Buffer 20
    Start-VM PC4
    vmconnect localhost PC4
    ```

2. Press ENTER when prompted to start the network boot service.

3. In the Task Sequence Wizard, provide the password: **pass@word1**, and then select **Next**.

4. Before you select **Next** in the Task Sequence Wizard, press the **F8** key. A command prompt will open.

5. At the command prompt, type **explorer.exe** and review the Windows PE file structure.

6. The smsts.log file is critical for troubleshooting any installation problems that might be encountered. Depending on the deployment phase, the smsts.log file is created in different locations:
   - X:\Windows\temp\SMSTSLog\smsts.log before disks are formatted.
   - X:\smstslog\smsts.log after disks are formatted.
   - C:\\_SMSTaskSequence\Logs\Smstslog\smsts.log before the Configuration Manager client is installed.
   - C:\Windows\ccm\logs\Smstslog\smsts.log after the Configuration Manager client is installed.
   - C:\Windows\ccm\logs\smsts.log when the task sequence is complete.

     Note: If a reboot is pending on the client, the reboot will be blocked as long as the command window is open.

7. In the explorer window, select **Tools** and then select **Map Network Drive**.

8. Don't map a network drive at this time. If you need to save the smsts.log file, you can use this method to save the file to a location on SRV1.

9. Close the Map Network Drive window, the Explorer window, and the command prompt.

10. The **Windows 10 Enterprise x64** task sequence is selected in the Task Sequence Wizard. Select **Next** to continue with the deployment.

11. The task sequence will require several minutes to complete. You can monitor progress of the task sequence using the MDT Deployment Workbench under Deployment Shares > MDTProduction > Monitoring. The task sequence will:
    - Install Windows 10
    - Install the Configuration Manager client and hotfix
    - Join the computer to the contoso.com domain
    - Install any applications that were specified in the reference image

12. When Windows 10 installation has completed, sign in to PC4 using the **contoso\administrator** account.

13. Right-click **Start**, select **Run**, type **control appwiz.cpl**, press ENTER, select **Turn Windows features on or off**, and verify that **.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)** is installed. This feature is included in the reference image.

14. Shut down the PC4 VM.

> [!NOTE]
> The following two procedures 1) Replace a client with Windows 10 and 2) Refresh a client with Windows 10 have been exchanged in their order in this guide compared to the previous version. This is to avoid having to restore Hyper-V checkpoints to have access to PC1 before the OS is upgraded. If this is your first time going through this guide, you won't notice any change, but if you have tried the guide previously then this change should make it simpler to complete.

## Replace a client with Windows 10 using Configuration Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start this section, you can delete computer objects from Active Directory that were created as part of previous deployment procedures. Use the Active Directory Users and Computers console on DC1 to remove stale entries under contoso.com\Computers, but do not delete the computer account (hostname) for PC1. There should be at least two computer accounts present in the contoso.com\Computers container: one for SRV1, and one for the hostname of PC1. It's not required to delete the stale entries, this action is only done to remove clutter.

![contoso.com\Computers.](images/poc-computers.png)

In the replace procedure, PC1 won't be migrated to a new OS. It's simplest to perform this procedure before performing the refresh procedure. After you refresh PC1, the OS will be new. The next (replace) procedure doesn't install a new OS on PC1 but rather performs a side-by-side migration of PC1 and another computer (PC4), to copy users and settings from PC1 to the new computer.

### Create a replace task sequence

1. On SRV1, in the Configuration Manager console, in the Software Library workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, right-click **Task Sequences**, and then select **Create MDT Task Sequence**.

2. On the Choose Template page, select **Client Replace Task Sequence** and select **Next**.

3. On the General page, type the following information:
    - Task sequence name: **Replace Task Sequence**
    - Task sequence comments: **USMT backup only**

4. Select **Next**, and on the Boot Image page, browse and select the **Zero Touch WinPE x64** boot image package. Select **OK** and then select **Next** to continue.
5. On the MDT Package page, browse and select the **MDT** package. Select **OK** and then select **Next** to continue.
6. On the USMT Package page, browse and select the **Microsoft Corporation User State Migration Tool for Windows** package. Select **OK** and then select **Next** to continue.
7. On the Settings Package page, browse and select the **Windows 10 x64 Settings** package. Select **OK** and then select **Next** to continue.
8. On the Summary page, review the details and then select **Next**.
9. On the Confirmation page, select **Finish**.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error is displayed at this stage, it can be caused by a corrupt MDT integration. To repair it, close the Configuration Manager console, remove MDT integration, and then restore MDT integration.

### Deploy PC4

Create a VM named PC4 to receive the applications and settings from PC1. This VM represents a new computer that will replace PC1. To create this VM, type the following commands at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host:

```powershell
New-VM -Name "PC4" -NewVHDPath "c:\vhd\pc4.vhdx" -NewVHDSizeBytes 60GB -SwitchName poc-internal -BootDevice NetworkAdapter -Generation 2
Set-VMMemory -VMName "PC4" -DynamicMemoryEnabled $true -MinimumBytes 1024MB -MaximumBytes 2048MB -Buffer 20
Set-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName PC4 -StaticMacAddress 00-15-5D-83-26-FF
```

> [!NOTE]
> Hyper-V lets you define a static MAC address on PC4. In a real-world scenario, you must determine the MAC address of the new computer.

### Install the Configuration Manager client on PC1

1. Verify that the PC1 VM is running and in its original state, which was saved as a checkpoint and then restored in [Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](windows-10-poc-mdt.md).

1. If you haven't already saved a checkpoint for PC1, then do it now. Type the following commands at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host:

    ```powershell
    Checkpoint-VM -Name PC1 -SnapshotName BeginState
    ```

1. On SRV1, in the Configuration Manager console, in the Administration workspace, expand **Hierarchy Configuration** and select on **Discovery Methods**.
1. Double-click **Active Directory System Discovery** and on the **General** tab select the **Enable Active Directory System Discovery** checkbox.
1. Select the yellow starburst, select **Browse**, select **contoso\Computers**, and then select **OK** three times.
1. When a popup dialog box asks if you want to run full discovery, select **Yes**.
1. In the Assets and Compliance workspace, select **Devices** and verify that the computer account names for SRV1 and PC1 are displayed. See the following example (GREGLIN-PC1 is the computer account name of PC1 in this example):

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't see the computer account for PC1, select **Refresh** in the upper right corner of the console.

    The **Client** column indicates that the Configuration Manager client isn't currently installed. This procedure will be carried out next.

1. Sign in to PC1 using the contoso\administrator account and type the following command at an elevated command prompt to remove any pre-existing client configuration, if it exists.

    > [!Note]
    > This command requires an elevated _command prompt_, not an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt.

    ```dos
    sc stop ccmsetup
    "\\SRV1\c$\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Client\CCMSetup.exe" /Uninstall
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If PC1 still has Configuration Manager registry settings that were applied by Group Policy, startup scripts, or other policies in its previous domain, these might not all be removed by `CCMSetup /Uninstall` and can cause problems with installation or registration of the client in its new environment. It might be necessary to manually remove these settings if they are present. For more information, see [Manual removal of the Configuration Manager client](/archive/blogs/michaelgriswold/manual-removal-of-the-sccm-client).

1. On PC1, temporarily stop Windows Update from queuing items for download and clear all BITS jobs from the queue. From an elevated command prompt, type:

    ```dos
    net stop wuauserv
    net stop BITS
    ```

    Verify that both services were stopped successfully, then type the following command at an elevated command prompt:

    ```dos
    del "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\Network\Downloader\qmgr*.dat"
    net start BITS
    bitsadmin /list /allusers
    ```

    Verify that BITSAdmin displays zero jobs.

1. To install the Configuration Manager client as a standalone process, type the following command at an elevated command prompt:

    ```dos
    "\\SRV1\c$\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Client\CCMSetup.exe" /mp:SRV1.contoso.com /logon SMSSITECODE=PS1
    ```

1. On PC1, using file explorer, open the **C:\Windows\ccmsetup** directory. During client installation, files will be downloaded here.
1. Installation progress will be captured in the file: **c:\windows\ccmsetup\logs\ccmsetup.log**. You can periodically open this file in notepad, or you can type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt to monitor installation progress:

    ```powershell
    Get-Content -Path c:\windows\ccmsetup\logs\ccmsetup.log -Wait
    ```

    Installation might require several minutes, and display of the log file will appear to hang while some applications are installed. This behavior is normal. When setup is complete, verify that **CcmSetup is existing with return code 0** is displayed on the last line of the ccmsetup.log file. Then press **CTRL-C** to break out of the Get-Content operation. If you're viewing the log file in Windows PowerShell, the last line will be wrapped. A return code of `0` indicates that installation was successful and you should now see a directory created at **C:\Windows\CCM** that contains files used in registration of the client with its site.

1. On PC1, open the Configuration Manager control panel applet by typing the following command from a command prompt:

    ```dos
    control smscfgrc
    ```

1. Select the **Site** tab, select **Configure Settings**, and select **Find Site**. The client will report that it has found the PS1 site. See the following example:

    ![site.](images/configmgr-site.png)

    If the client isn't able to find the PS1 site, review any error messages that are displayed in **C:\Windows\CCM\Logs\ClientIDManagerStartup.log** and **LocationServices.log**. A common reason the client can't locate the site code is because a previous configuration exists. For example, if a previous site code is configured at **HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Mobile Client\GPRequestedSiteAssignmentCode**, delete or update this entry.

1. On SRV1, in the Assets and Compliance workspace, select **Device Collections** and then double-click **All Desktop and Server Clients**. This node will be added under **Devices**.

1. Select **All Desktop and Server Clients** and verify that the computer account for PC1 is displayed here with **Yes** and **Active** in the **Client** and **Client Activity** columns, respectively. You might have to refresh the view and wait few minutes for the client to appear here.  See the following example:

    ![client.](images/configmgr-client.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take several minutes for the client to fully register with the site and complete a client check. When it's complete you will see a green check mark over the client icon as shown above. To refresh the client, select it and then press **F5** or right-click the client and select **Refresh**.

### Create a device collection and deployment

1. On SRV1, in the Configuration Manager console, in the Asset and Compliance workspace, right-click **Device Collections** and then select **Create Device Collection**.

2. Use the following settings in the **Create Device Collection Wizard**:

    ```powershell
    Start-VM PC4
    vmconnect localhost PC4
    ```

1. In the **Welcome to the Task Sequence Wizard**, enter **pass@word1** and select **Next**.
1. Choose the **Windows 10 Enterprise X64** image.
1. Setup will install the OS using the Windows 10 Enterprise x64 reference image, install the configuration manager client, join PC4 to the domain, and restore users and settings from PC1.
1. Save checkpoints for all VMs if you wish to review their status at a later date. This action isn't required, as checkpoints do take up space on the Hyper-V host.

    > [!Note]
    > The next procedure will install a new OS on PC1, and update its status in Configuration Manager and in Active Directory as a Windows 10 device. So you can't return to a previous checkpoint only on the PC1 VM without a conflict. Therefore, if you do create a checkpoint, you should do this action for all VMs.

    To save a checkpoint for all VMs, type the following commands at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host:

    ```powershell
    Checkpoint-VM -Name DC1 -SnapshotName cm-refresh
    Checkpoint-VM -Name SRV1 -SnapshotName cm-refresh
    Checkpoint-VM -Name PC1 -SnapshotName cm-refresh
    ```

## Refresh a client with Windows 10 using Configuration Manager
