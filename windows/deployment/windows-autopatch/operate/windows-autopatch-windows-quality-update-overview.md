# Windows quality updates

## Service level objective

Windows Autopatch aims to keep at least 95% of eligible devices on the latest Windows quality update 21 days after release.

## Device eligibility

For a device to be eligible for Windows quality updates as a part of Windows Autopatch they must meet the following criteria:

| Criteria | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Activity | Devices must have at least six hours of usage, with at least two hours being continuous. |
| Intune sync | Devices must have checked with Intune within the last five days. |
| Storage space | Devices must have more than one GB (GigaBytes) of free storage space. |
| Deployed | Windows Autopatch doesn't update devices that haven't yet been deployed. |
| Internet connectivity | Devices must have a steady internet connection, and access to Windows [update endpoints](../prepare/windows-autopatch-configure-network.md). |
| Windows edition | Devices must be on a Windows edition supported by Windows Autopatch. For more information, see [Prerequisites](../prepare/windows-autopatch-prerequisites.md). |
| Mobile device management (MDM) policy conflict | Devices must not have deployed any policies that would prevent device management. For more information, see [Conflicting and unsupported policies](../references/windows-autopatch-windows-update-unsupported-policies.md). |
| Group policy conflict | Devices must not have group policies deployed which would prevent device management. For more information, see [Group policy](../references/windows-autopatch-windows-update-unsupported-policies.md#group-policy-and-other-policy-managers) |

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Autopatch supports registering [Windows 10 Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/windows/whats-new/ltsc/) devices that are being currently serviced by the [Windows LTSC](/windows/release-health/release-information). The service only supports managing the [Windows quality updates](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md) workload for devices currently serviced by the LTSC. Additionally, Windows Autopatch can only manage Windows quality updates for devices that haven't reached the LTSC's [end of servicing date](/windows/release-health/release-information#enterprise-and-iot-enterprise-ltsbltsc-editions).

## Windows quality update releases

Windows Autopatch deploys the [Monthly security update releases](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-quality-updates-primer/ba-p/2569385) that are released on the second Tuesday of each month.

To release updates to devices in a gradual manner, Windows Autopatch deploys a set of mobile device management (MDM) policies to each update deployment ring to control the rollout. There are three primary policies that are used to control Windows quality updates:

| Policy | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| [Deferrals](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-deferqualityupdatesperiodindays) | Deferral policies delay the time the update is offered to the device by a specific number of days. The "offer" date for Windows quality updates is equal to the number of days specified in the deferral policy after the second Tuesday of each month. |
| [Deadlines](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-autorestartdeadlineperiodindays)    | Before the deadline, restarts can be scheduled by users or automatically scheduled outside of active hours. After the deadline passes, restarts will occur regardless of active hours and users won't be able to reschedule. The deadline for a specific device is set to be the specified number of days after the update is offered to the device. |
| [Grace periods](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-configuredeadlinegraceperiod) | This policy specifies a minimum number of days after an update is downloaded until the device is automatically restarted. This policy overrides the deadline policy so that if a user comes back from vacation, it prevents the device from forcing a restart to complete the update as soon as it comes online. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploying deferral, deadline, or grace period policies which conflict with Autopatch's policies will cause a device to be considered ineligible for management, it will still receive policies from Windows Autopatch that are not in conflict, but may not function as designed.  These devices will be marked as ineligible in our device reporting and will not count towards our [service level objective](#service-level-objective).

Windows Autopatch configures these policies differently across deployment rings to gradually release the update to devices in your estate. Devices in the Test ring receive changes first and devices in the Broad ring receive changes last. For more information, see [Windows Autopatch deployment rings](../operate/windows-autopatch-update-management.md#windows-autopatch-deployment-rings).

## Release management

> [!NOTE]
> To access the Release management blade, you must have the correct [role-based access control](../deploy/windows-autopatch-register-devices.md#built-in-roles-required-for-device-registration).

In the Release management blade, you can:

- Track the [Windows quality update schedule](#release-schedule) for devices in the [four deployment rings](windows-autopatch-update-management.md#windows-autopatch-deployment-rings).
- [Turn off expedited Windows quality updates](#turn-off-service-driven-expedited-quality-update-releases).
- Review release announcements and knowledge based articles for regular and [Out of Band (OOB) Windows quality updates](#out-of-band-releases).

### Release schedule

For each [deployment ring](windows-autopatch-update-management.md#windows-autopatch-deployment-rings), the **Release schedule** tab contains:

- The status of the update. Releases will appear as **Active**. The update schedule is based on the values of the [Windows 10 Update Ring policies](/mem/intune/protect/windows-update-for-business-configure), which have been configured on your behalf.
- The date the update is available.
- The target completion date of the update.
- In the **Release schedule** tab, you can either [**Pause** and/or **Resume**](#pausing-and-resuming-a-release) a Windows quality update release.

### Expedited releases

Threat and vulnerability information about a new revision of Windows becomes available on the second Tuesday of each month. Windows Autopatch assesses that information shortly afterwards. If the service determines that it's critical to security, it may be expedited. The quality update is also evaluated on an ongoing basis throughout the release and Windows Autopatch may choose to expedite at any time during the release.

When running an expedited release, the regular goal of 95% of devices in 21 days no longer applies. Instead, Windows Autopatch greatly accelerates the release schedule of the release to update the environment more quickly. This approach requires an updated schedule for all devices outside of the Test ring since those devices are already getting the update quickly.

| Release type | Group | Deferral | Deadline | Grace period |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard release | Test<p>First<p>Fast<p>Broad | 0<p>1<p>6<p>9 | 0<p>2<p>2<p>5 | 0<p>2<p>2<p>2 |
| Expedited release | All devices | 0 | 1 | 1 |

#### Turn off service-driven expedited quality update releases

Windows Autopatch provides the option to turn off of service-driven expedited quality updates.

By default, the service expedites quality updates as needed. For those organizations seeking greater control, you can disable expedited quality updates for Windows Autopatch-enrolled devices using Microsoft Intune.

**To turn off service-driven expedited quality updates:**

1. Go to **[Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)** > **Devices**.
2. Under **Windows Autopatch** > **Release management**, go to the **Release settings** tab and turn off the **Expedited quality updates** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Autopatch doesn't allow customers to request expedited releases.

### Out of Band releases

Windows Autopatch schedules and deploys required Out of Band (OOB) updates released outside of the normal schedule.

**To view deployed Out of Band quality updates:**

1. Go to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows Autopatch** > **Release management**.
2. Under the **Release Announcements** tab, you can view the knowledge base (KB) articles corresponding to deployed OOB and regular Windows quality updates.

> [!NOTE]
> Announcements will be **removed** from the Release announcements tab when the next quality update is released. Further, if quality updates are paused for a deployment ring, the OOB updates will also be paused.

### Pausing and resuming a release

> [!CAUTION]
> You should only pause and resume [Windows quality](windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#pausing-and-resuming-a-release) and [Windows feature updates](#pausing-and-resuming-a-release) on Windows Autopatch managed devices using the Windows Autopatch Release management blade. Do **not** use the Microsoft Intune end-user experience flows to pause or resume Windows Autopatch managed devices. If you need assistance with pausing and resuming updates, please [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md).

The service-level pause of updates is driven by the various software update deployment-related signals Windows Autopatch receives from Windows Update for Business, and several other product groups within Microsoft.

If Windows Autopatch detects a [significant issue with a release](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-signals.md), we may decide to pause that release.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pausing or resuming an update can take up to eight hours to be applied to devices. Windows Autopatch uses Microsoft Intune as its management solution and that's the average frequency devices take to communicate back to Microsoft Intune with new instructions to pause, resume or rollback updates.<p>For more information, see [how long does it take for devices to get a policy, profile, or app after they are assigned from Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot#how-long-does-it-take-for-devices-to-get-a-policy-profile-or-app-after-they-are-assigned).</p>

**To pause or resume a Windows quality update:**

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** from the left navigation menu.
3. Under the **Windows Autopatch** section, select **Release management**.
4. In the **Release management** blade, select either: **Pause** or **Resume**.
5. Select the update type you would like to pause or resume.
6. Select a reason from the dropdown menu.
7. Optional. Enter details about why you're pausing or resuming the selected update.
8. If you're resuming an update, you can select one or more deployment rings.
9. Select **Okay**.

The three following statuses are associated with paused quality updates:

| Status | Description |
| ----- | ------ |
| Service Pause | If the Windows Autopatch service has paused an update, the release will have the **Service Pause** status. You must [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md) to resume the update. |
| Customer Pause | If you've paused an update, the release will have the **Customer Pause** status. The Windows Autopatch service can't overwrite an IT admin's pause. You must select **Resume** to resume the update. |
| Customer & Service Pause | If you and Windows Autopatch have both paused an update, the release will have the **Customer & Service Pause** status. If you resume the update, and the **Service Pause** status still remains, you must [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md) for Windows Autopatch to resume the update deployment on your behalf. |

## Remediating Ineligible and/or Not up to Date devices

To ensure your devices receive Windows quality updates, Windows Autopatch provides information on how you can remediate [Ineligible Devices (Customer Actions)](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-reports-overview.md#ineligible-devices-customer-action). In addition, the Windows Autopatch service may remediate [Not up to Date devices](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-reports-overview.md#not-up-to-date-microsoft-action) to bring them back into compliance.
