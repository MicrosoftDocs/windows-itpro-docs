# Deregister a device

To avoid end-user disruption, device deregistration in Windows Autopatch only deletes the Windows Autopatch device record itself. Device deregistration can't delete Microsoft Intune and/or the Azure Active Directory device records. Microsoft assumes you'll keep managing those devices yourself in some capacity.

**To deregister a device:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Windows Autopatch** in the left navigation menu.
1. Select **Devices**.
1. In either **Ready** or **Not ready** tab, select the device(s) you want to deregister.
1. Once a device or multiple devices are selected, select **Device actions**, then select **Deregister device**.

> [!WARNING]
> Removing devices from the Windows Autopatch Device Registration Azure AD group doesn't deregister devices from the Windows Autopatch service.

## Excluded devices

When you deregister a device from the Windows Autopatch service, the device is flagged as "excluded" so Windows Autopatch doesn't try to reregister the device into the service again, since the deregistration command doesn't trigger device membership removal from the **Windows Autopatch Device Registration** Azure Active Directory group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure AD team doesn't recommend appending query statements to remove specific device from a dynamic query due to dynamic query performance issues.

If you want to reregister a device that was previously deregistered from Windows Autopatch, you must [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md) with the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team to request the removal of the "excluded" flag set during the deregistration process. After the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team removes the flag, you can reregister a device or a group of devices.  

## Hiding unregistered devices

You can hide unregistered devices you don't expect to be remediated anytime soon.

**To hide unregistered devices:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Windows Autopatch** in the left navigation menu.
1. Select **Devices**.
1. In the **Not ready** tab, select an unregistered device or a group of unregistered devices you want to hide then select **Status == All**.
1. Unselect the **Registration failed** status checkbox from the list.
