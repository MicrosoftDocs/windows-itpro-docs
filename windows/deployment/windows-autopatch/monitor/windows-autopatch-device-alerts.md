# Device alerts

Windows Autopatch and Windows Updates use Device alerts to provide notifications and information about the necessary steps to keep your devices up to date. In Windows Autopatch reporting, every device is provided with a section for alerts. If no alerts are listed, no action is needed. Navigate to **Reports** > **Quality update status** or **Feature update status** > **Device** > select the **Device alerts** column. The provided information helps you understand:

- Microsoft and/or Windows Autopatch performs the action(s) to keep the device properly updated.
- The actions you must perform so the device can properly be updated.

> [!NOTE]
> At any given point, one or both of these actions can be present in your tenant.

## Windows Autopatch alerts

Windows Autopatch alerts are alerts specific to the Windows Autopatch service. These alerts include:

- [Post-device registration readiness checks](../deploy/windows-autopatch-post-reg-readiness-checks.md)
- [Policy health and remediation](../operate/windows-autopatch-policy-health-and-remediation.md)

## Windows quality and feature update alerts

These alerts represent data reported to the Windows Update service related to Windows quality and feature updates. These alerts can help identify actions that must be performed if an update doesn't apply as expected. Alerts are only provided by device that actively reports to the Windows Update service.

## Customer and Microsoft Actions

Windows Autopatch assigns alerts to either Microsoft Action or Customer Action. These assignments give a clear understanding of who has the responsibility to remediate the alert.

| Assignment | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Microsoft Action | Refers to the responsibility of the Windows Autopatch service to remediate. Windows Autopatch performs these actions automatically. |
| Customer Action | Refers to your responsibility to carry out the appropriate action(s) to resolve the reported alert. |

## Alert resolutions

Alert resolutions are provided through the Windows Update service and provide the reason why an update didn't perform as expected. The recommended actions are general recommendations and if additional assistance is needed, [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md).
