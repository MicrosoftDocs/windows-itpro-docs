# Windows feature update summary dashboard

The Summary dashboard provides a broader view of the current Windows OS update status for all devices registered with Windows Autopatch.

The first part of the Summary dashboard provides you with an all-devices trend report where you can follow the deployment trends within your organization. You can view if updates were successfully installed, failing, in progress, not ready or have their Windows feature update paused.

**To view a generated Summary dashboard for your Windows feature update deployments:**

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Reports** from the left navigation menu.
1. Under the **Windows Autopatch** section, select **Windows feature updates**.
