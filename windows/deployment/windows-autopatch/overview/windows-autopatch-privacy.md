# Privacy

Windows Autopatch is a cloud service for enterprise customers designed to keep employees' Windows devices updated. This article provides details about data platform and privacy compliance for Windows Autopatch.

## Windows Autopatch data sources and purpose

Windows Autopatch provides its service to enterprise customers, and properly administers customers' enrolled devices by using data from various sources.

The sources include Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Windows 10/11. The sources provide a comprehensive view of the devices that Windows Autopatch manages.

| Data source | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Microsoft Windows 10/11 Enterprise](/windows/windows-10/) | Management of device setup experience, managing connections to other services, and operational support for IT pros. |
| [Windows Update for Business](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) | Uses Windows 10/11 Enterprise diagnostic data to provide additional information on Windows 10/11 update. |
| [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) | Device management and to keep your data secure. The following endpoint management data sources are used:<br><ul><li>[Microsoft Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/): Authentication and identification of all user accounts.</li><li>[Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/): Distributing device configurations, device management and application management.</li></ul>
| [Windows Autopatch](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) | Data provided by the customer or generated by the service during running of the service. |
| [Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans)| Management of Microsoft 365 Apps. |

## Windows Autopatch data process and storage

Windows Autopatch relies on data from multiple Microsoft products and services to provide its service to enterprise customers.

To protect and maintain enrolled devices, we process and copy data from these services to Windows Autopatch. When we process data, we follow the documented directions you provide as referenced in the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

Processor duties of Windows Autopatch include ensuring appropriate confidentiality, security, and resilience. Windows Autopatch employs additional privacy and security measures to ensure proper handling of personal identifiable data.

## Windows Autopatch data storage and staff location

Windows Autopatch stores its data in the Azure data centers based on your data residency. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 data center locations](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <ul><li>As of November 8, 2022, only <b>new</b> Windows Autopatch customers (EU, UK, Africa, Middle East) will have their data live in the European data centers.</li><li>Existing European Union (EU) Windows Autopatch customers will move from the North American data centers to the European data centers by the end of 2022.</li><li>If you're an existing Windows Autopatch customer, but <b>not</b> part of the European Union, data migration from North America to your respective data residency will occur next year.</li></ul>

Data obtained by Windows Autopatch and other services are required to keep the service operational. If a device is removed from Windows Autopatch, we keep data for a maximum of 30 days. For more information on data retention, see [Data retention, deletion, and destruction in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview).

Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team is in the United States, India and Romania.

## Microsoft Windows 10/11 diagnostic data

Windows Autopatch uses [Windows 10/11 Enhanced diagnostic data](/windows/privacy/windows-diagnostic-data) to keep Windows secure, up to date, fix problems, and make product improvements.

The enhanced diagnostic data setting includes more detailed information about the devices enrolled in Windows Autopatch and their settings, capabilities, and device health. When enhanced diagnostic data is selected, data, including required diagnostic data, are collected. For more information, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection) about the Windows 10/11 diagnostic data setting and data collection.

The diagnostic data terminology will change in future versions of Windows. Windows Autopatch is committed to processing only the data that the service needs. The diagnostic level will change to **Optional**, but Windows Autopatch will implement the limited diagnostic policies to fine-tune diagnostic data collection required for the service. For more information, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection).

Windows Autopatch only processes and stores system-level data from Windows 10/11 optional diagnostic data that originates from enrolled devices such as application and device reliability, and performance information. Windows Autopatch doesn't process and store customers' data such as chat and browser history, voice, text, or speech data.

For more information about the diagnostic data collection of Microsoft Windows 10/11, see the [Where we store and process data](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule) section of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

## Tenant access

For more information about tenant access and changes made to your tenant upon enrolling into Windows Autopatch, see [Changes made at tenant enrollment](../references/windows-autopatch-changes-to-tenant.md).

### Service accounts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting October 12, 2022, Windows Autopatch will manage your tenant with our [enterprise application](../references/windows-autopatch-changes-to-tenant.md#windows-autopatch-enterprise-applications). If your tenant is still using the [Windows Autopatch service accounts](windows-autopatch-privacy.md#service-accounts), you must take action. To take action or see if you need to take action, visit the [Tenant management blade](../operate/windows-autopatch-maintain-environment.md#windows-autopatch-tenant-actions) in the Windows Autopatch portal.

Windows Autopatch creates and uses guest accounts using just-in-time access functionality when signing into a customer tenant to manage the Windows Autopatch service. To provide additional locked down control, Windows Autopatch maintains a separate conditional access policy to restrict access to these accounts.
