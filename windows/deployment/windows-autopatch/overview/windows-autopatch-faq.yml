  - name: Update management
    questions: 
      - question: What systems does Windows Autopatch update?
        answer: |
          - Windows 10/11 quality updates: Windows Autopatch manages all aspects of deployment rings.
          - Windows 10/11 feature updates: Windows Autopatch manages all aspects of deployment rings.
          - Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise updates: All devices registered for Windows Autopatch will receive updates from the Monthly Enterprise Channel.
          - Microsoft Edge: Windows Autopatch configures eligible devices to benefit from Microsoft Edge's progressive rollouts on the Stable channel and will provide support for issues with Microsoft Edge updates.
          - Microsoft Teams: Windows Autopatch allows eligible devices to benefit from the standard automatic update channels and will provide support for issues with Teams updates.
      - question: What does Windows Autopatch do to ensure updates are done successfully?
        answer: |
          For Windows quality and feature updates, updates are applied to devices in the Test ring first. The devices are evaluated, and then rolled out to the First, Fast then Broad rings. There's an evaluation period at each progression. This process is dependent on customer testing and verification of all updates during these rollout stages. The outcome is to ensure that registered devices are always up to date and disruption to business operations is minimized to free up your IT department from that ongoing task.
      - question: What happens if there's an issue with an update?
        answer: |
          Autopatch relies on the following capabilities to help resolve update issues:
          - Pausing and resuming: For more information about pausing and resuming updates, see [pausing and resuming Windows quality updates](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#pausing-and-resuming-a-release).
          - Rollback: For more information about Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, see [Update controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../operate/windows-autopatch-microsoft-365-apps-enterprise.md#microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise-update-controls).
      - question: Can I permanently pause a Windows feature update deployment?
        answer: |
          Yes. Windows Autopatch provides a [permanent pause of a feature update deployment](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-feature-update-overview.md#pausing-and-resuming-a-release).
      - question: Will Windows quality updates be released more quickly after vulnerabilities are identified, or what is the regular cadence of updates?
        answer: |
          For zero-day threats, Autopatch will have an [expedited release cadence](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#expedited-releases). For normal updates Autopatch, uses a [regular release cadence](../operate/windows-autopatch-wqu-overview.md#windows-quality-update-releases) starting with devices in the Test ring and completing with general rollout to the Broad ring.
      - question: Can customers configure when to move to the next ring or is it controlled by Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          The decision of when to move to the next ring is handled by Windows Autopatch; it isn't customer configurable.
      - question: Can you customize the scheduling of an update rollout to only install on certain days and times?
        answer: |
          No, you can't customize update scheduling. However, you can specify [active hours](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-end-user-exp.md#servicing-window) to prevent users from updating during business hours.
      - question: Does Autopatch support include and exclude groups, or dynamic groups to define deployment ring membership?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopatch doesn't support managing update deployment ring membership using your Azure AD groups. For more information, see [Moving devices in between deployment rings](../operate/windows-autopatch-update-management.md#moving-devices-in-between-deployment-rings).
      - question: Does Autopatch have two release cadences per update or are there two release cadences per-ring?
        answer: |
          The release cadences are defined based on the update type. For example, a [regular cadence](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#windows-quality-update-releases) (for a Windows quality update would be a gradual rollout from the Test ring to the Broad ring over 14 days whereas an [expedited release](../operate/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#expedited-releases) would roll out more rapidly.
  - name: Support
    questions:
      - question: What support is available for customers who need help with onboarding to Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          The FastTrack Center is the primary mode of support for customers who need assistance from Microsoft to meet the pre-requisites (such as Intune and Azure or Hybrid AD) for onboarding to Windows Autopatch. For more information, see [Microsoft FastTrack for Windows Autopatch](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md#microsoft-fasttrack). When you've onboarded with Windows Autopatch, you can [submit a support request](../operate/windows-autopatch-support-request.md) with the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team.
      - question: Does Windows Autopatch Support Dual Scan for Windows Update?
        answer: |
          Dual Scan for Windows has been deprecated and replaced with the [scan source policy](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-wsus). Windows Autopatch supports the scan source policy if the Feature updates, and Windows quality updates workloads are configured for Windows update. If Feature and Windows updates are configured for WSUS, it could cause disruptions to the service and your release schedules.
