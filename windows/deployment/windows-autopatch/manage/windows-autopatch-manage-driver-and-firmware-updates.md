# Manage driver and firmware updates

You can manage and control your driver and firmware updates with Windows Autopatch. You can choose to receive driver and firmware updates automatically, or self-manage the deployment.

> [!TIP]
> Windows Autopatch's driver and firmware update management is based on [Intune's driver and firmware update management](/mem/intune/protect/windows-driver-updates-overview). You can use **both** Intune and Windows Autopatch to manage your driver and firmware updates.

## Automatic and Self-managed modes

Switching the toggle between Automatic and Self-managed modes creates driver profiles on a per-ring basis within your tenant.

| Modes | Description |
| ----- | -----|
| Automatic | We recommend using **Automatic** mode.<p>Automatic mode (default) is recommended for organizations with standard Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) devices where no recent driver or hardware issues have occurred due to Windows Updates. Automatic mode ensures the most secure drivers are installed using Autopatch deployment ring rollout.</p> |
| Self-managed | When you use **Self-managed** mode, no drivers are installed in your environment without your explicit approval. You can still use Intune to choose specific drivers and deploy them on a ring-by-ring basis.<p>Self-managed mode turns off Windows Autopatch's automatic driver deployment. Instead, the Administrator controls the driver deployment.<p>The Administrator selects the individual driver within an Intune driver update profile. Then, Autopatch creates an Intune driver update profile per deployment ring. Drivers can vary between deployment rings.</p><p>The drivers listed for selection represent only the drivers needed for the targeted clients, which are the Autopatch rings. Therefore, the drivers offered may vary between rings depending on the variety of device hardware in an organization.</p> |

## Set driver and firmware updates to Automatic or Self-managed mode

**To set driver and firmware updates to Automatic or Self-managed mode:**

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Navigate to **Devices** > **Windows Autopatch** > **Release management** > **Release settings**.
1. In the **Windows Driver Updates** section, read and accept the agreement.
1. Select either **Automatic** or **Self-managed**.

## View driver and firmware policies created by Windows Autopatch

**To view driver and firmware policies created by Windows Autopatch:**

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Navigate to **Devices** > **Driver updates for Windows 10 and later**.
1. Windows Autopatch creates four policies. The policy names begin with **Windows Autopatch - Driver Update Policy** and end with the name of the deployment ring to which they're targeted in brackets. For example, **Windows Autopatch - Driver Update Policy [Test]**.

The `CreateDriverUpdatePolicy` is created for the Test, First, Fast, and Broad deployment rings. The policy settings are defined in the following table:

| Policy name | DisplayName | Description | Approval Type | DeploymentDeferralInDays |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `CreateDriverUpdatePolicy` | Windows Autopatch - Driver Update Policy [**Test**] | Driver Update Policy for device **Test** group | Automatic | `0` |
