# Submit a support request

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you've [added and verified your admin contacts](../deploy/windows-autopatch-admin-contacts.md). The Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team will contact these individuals for assistance with remediating issues.

## Submit a new support request

Support requests are triaged and responded to as they're received.

**To submit a new support request:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and navigate to the **Tenant administration** menu.
1. In the **Windows Autopatch** section, select **Support requests**.
1. In the **Support requests** section, select **+ New support request**.
1. Enter your question(s) and/or a description of the problem.
1. Review all the information you provided for accuracy.
1. When you're ready, select **Create**.

### Premier and Unified support options

If you have a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract, when you submit a new request, or edit an active support request, you can:

- Specify the severity of your issue
- Schedule a support callback for a specific day and time

Depending on your support contract, the following severity options are available:

| Support contract | Severity options |
| ----- | ----- |
| Premier | Severity A, B or C |
| Unified | Critical or non-critical |

## Manage an active support request

The primary contact for the support request will receive email notifications when a case is created, assigned to a service engineer to investigate, and mitigated. If, at any point, you have a question about the case, the best way to get in touch is to reply directly to one of those emails. If we have questions about your request or need more details, we'll email the primary contact listed on the support requests.

## View all your active support requests

You can see the summary status of all your support requests. At any time, you can use the portal to see all active support requests in the last six months.

**To view all your active support requests:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and navigate to the **Tenant Administration** menu.
1. In the **Windows Autopatch** section, select **Support request**.
1. From this view, you can export the summary view or select any case to view the details.

## Edit support request details

You can edit support request details, for example, updating the primary case contact.

**To edit support request details:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and navigate to the **Tenant Administration** menu.
1. In the **Windows Autopatch** section, select **Support request**.
1. In the **Support requests** section, use the search bar or filters to find the case you want to edit.
1. Select the case to open the request's details.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the request details and select **Edit**.
1. Update the editable information, add attachments to the case, or add a note for the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team.
1. Select **Save**.

Once a support request is mitigated, it can no longer be edited. If a request has been mitigated for less than 24 hours, you'll see the option to reactivate instead of edit. Once reactivated, you can again edit the request.
