# Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise update policies

## Conflicting and unsupported policies

Deploying any of the following policies to a managed device makes that device ineligible for management since the device prevents us from delivering the service as designed.

### Update policies

Window Autopatch deploys mobile device management (MDM) policies to configure Microsoft 365 Apps and requires a specific configuration. If any [Microsoft 365 Apps update settings](/deployoffice/configure-update-settings-microsoft-365-apps) are deployed which conflict with our policies, then the device isn't eligible for management.
