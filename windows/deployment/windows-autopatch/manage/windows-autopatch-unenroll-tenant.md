# Unenroll your tenant

If you're looking to unenroll your tenant from Windows Autopatch, this article details what unenrollment means for your organization and what actions you must take.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a Global Administrator to unenroll your tenant.

Unenrolling from Windows Autopatch requires manual actions from both you and from the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team. The Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team will:

- Remove Windows Autopatch access to your tenant.
- Exclude your devices from the Windows Autopatch service. Excluding your devices from Windows Autopatch won't remove your devices from Intune, Microsoft Entra ID or Configuration Manager. The Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team follows the same process and principles as laid out in [Exclude a device](../operate/windows-autopatch-exclude-device.md).
- Delete all data that we've stored in the Windows Autopatch data storage.

> [!NOTE]
> We will **not** delete any of your customer or Intune data.

## Microsoft's responsibilities during unenrollment

| Responsibility | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Windows Autopatch data | Windows Autopatch will delete user data that is within the Windows Autopatch service. We won't make changes to any other data. For more information about how data is used in Windows Autopatch, see [Privacy](../overview/windows-autopatch-privacy.md). |
| Excluding devices | Windows Autopatch will exclude all devices previously registered with the service. Only the Windows Autopatch device record is deleted. We won't delete Microsoft Intune and/or Microsoft Entra device records. For more information, see [Exclude a device](../operate/windows-autopatch-exclude-device.md). |

## Your responsibilities after unenrolling your tenant

| Responsibility | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Updates | After the Windows Autopatch service is unenrolled, we'll no longer provide updates to your devices.  You must ensure that your devices continue to receive updates through your own policies to ensure they're secure and up to date. |
| Optional Windows Autopatch configuration | Windows Autopatch won't remove the configuration policies or groups used to enable updates on your devices. You're responsible for these policies following tenant unenrollment. If you don't wish to use these policies for your devices after unenrollment, you may safely delete them. For more information, see [Changes made at tenant enrollment](../references/windows-autopatch-changes-to-tenant.md). |
| Microsoft Intune roles | After unenrollment, you may safely remove the Modern Workplace Intune Admin role. |
