# Monitor activation

> - [Activate Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/activate-windows-c39005d4-95ee-b91e-b399-2820fda32227).
> - [Product activation for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/product-activation-for-windows-online-support-telephone-numbers-35f6a805-1259-88b4-f5e9-b52cccef91a0).

The success of the activation process for a computer running Windows can be monitored in several ways. The most popular methods include:

- Using the Volume Licensing Service Center website to track use of MAK keys.

- Using the `Slmgr /dlv` command on a client computer or on the KMS host. For a full list of options, see [Slmgr.vbs options for obtaining volume activation information](/windows-server/get-started/activation-slmgr-vbs-options).

- Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to view licensing status. WMI makes licensing status available to non-Microsoft or custom tools that can access WMI. Windows PowerShell can also be used to access WMI information.

- Most licensing actions and events are recorded in the Event log (ex: Application Log events 12288-12290).

- Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and the KMS Management Pack can provide insight and information to users of System Center Operations Manager.

- See [Troubleshooting activation error codes](/troubleshoot/windows-server/licensing-and-activation/troubleshoot-activation-error-codes) for information about troubleshooting procedures for Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or the Key Management Service (KMS).

- The Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) provides a single site from which to manage and monitor volume activations. For more information, see [Introduction to VAMT](introduction-vamt.md).
