# Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) technical reference

The Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) lets you automate and centrally manage the Windows, Office, and select other Microsoft products volume and retail-activation process. VAMT can manage volume activation using Multiple Activation Keys (MAKs) or the Windows Key Management Service (KMS). VAMT is a standard Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. VAMT can be installed on any computer that has a supported Windows OS version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> VAMT is designed to manage volume activation for all currently supported versions of Windows, Windows Server, and Office.

VAMT is only available in an EN-US (x86) package.
