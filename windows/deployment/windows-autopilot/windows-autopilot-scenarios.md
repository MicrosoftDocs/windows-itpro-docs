# Windows Autopilot scenarios

**Applies to: Windows 10**

Windows Autopilot includes support for a growing list of scenarios, designed to support common organization needs which can vary based on the type of organization and their progress moving to Windows 10 and [transitioning to modern management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/manage-windows-10-in-your-organization-modern-management).

For details about these scenarios, see these additional topics:

-   [Windows Autopilot user-driven mode](user-driven.md), for devices that will be set up by a member of the organization and configured for that person.
-   [Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode](self-deploying.md), for devices that will be automatically configured for shared use, as a kiosk, or as a digital signage device.
-   [Windows Autopilot Reset](windows-autopilot-reset.md),
