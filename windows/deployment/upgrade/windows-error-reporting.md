When Windows Setup fails, the result and extend code are recorded as an informational event in the Application log by Windows Error Reporting as event 1001. The event name is **WinSetupDiag02**.  Event Viewer or Windows PowerShell can be used to review this event.

To use Windows PowerShell, type the following commands from an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The following Event logs are only available if Windows was updated from a previous version of Windows to a new version of Windows.

```powershell
$events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName="Application";ID="1001";Data="WinSetupDiag02"}
$event = [xml]$events[0].ToXml()
$event.Event.EventData.Data
```

To use Event Viewer:

1. Open Event Viewer and navigate to **Windows Logs\Application**.
1. Select **Find**, and then search for **winsetupdiag02**.
1. Double-click the event that is highlighted.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For legacy operating systems, the Event Name was WinSetupDiag01.

Ten parameters are listed in the event:

| Parameters  |
| ------------- |
| P1: The Setup Scenario (1=Media,5=WindowsUpdate,7=Media Creation Tool) |
| P2: Setup Mode (x=default,1=Downlevel,5=Rollback) |
| P3: New OS Architecture (x=default,0=X86,9=AMD64) |
| P4: Install Result (x=default,0=Success,1=Failure,2=Cancel,3=Blocked) |
| **P5: Result Error Code**  (Ex: 0xc1900101) |
| **P6: Extend Error Code**  (Ex: 0x20017) |
| P7: Source OS build (Ex: 9600) |
| P8: Source OS branch (not typically available) |
| P9: New OS build (Ex: 16299) |
| P10: New OS branch (Ex: rs3_release) |

The event also contains links to log files that can be used to perform a detailed diagnosis of the error. The following example is an example of this event from a successful upgrade:
