When Windows Setup fails, the result and extend code are recorded as an informational event in the Application log by Windows Error Reporting as event 1001. The event name is **WinSetupDiag02**.  You can use Event Viewer to review this event, or you can use Windows PowerShell.

To use Windows PowerShell, type the following commands from an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following source will be available only if you have updated from a previous version of Windows 10 to a new version. If you installed the current version and have not updated, the source named **WinSetupDiag02** will be unavailable.

```powershell
$events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName="Application";ID="1001";Data="WinSetupDiag02"}
$event = [xml]$events[0].ToXml()
$event.Event.EventData.Data
```

To use Event Viewer: 
1. Open Event Viewer and navigate to **Windows Logs\Application**.
2. Select **Find**, and then search for **winsetupdiag02**.
3. Double-click the event that is highlighted.

> [!NOTE]
> For legacy operating systems, the Event Name was WinSetupDiag01. 

Ten parameters are listed in the event:

|P2: Setup Mode (x=default,1=Downlevel,5=Rollback)   | 
|P3: New OS Architecture (x=default,0=X86,9=AMD64)   | 
|P4: Install Result (x=default,0=Success,1=Failure,2=Cancel,3=Blocked)   |

|P7: Source OS build (Ex: 9600)   | 
|P8: Source OS branch (not typically available)   | 
|P9: New OS build (Ex: 16299}   |
