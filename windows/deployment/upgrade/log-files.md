# Windows upgrade log files

> [!NOTE]
>
> The following is a level 400 (advanced) topic. See [Resolve Windows upgrade errors](resolve-windows-upgrade-errors.md) for a full list of articles in this section.

Each phase of the upgrade process creates several log files, which are essential for troubleshooting upgrade problems. By default, the folders that contain these log files are hidden on the upgrade target computer. To view the log files, configure File Explorer to view hidden items, or use a tool to gather these logs. The most useful log is **setupact.log**. The log files are in a different folder depending on the Windows Setup phase, which can be determined from the extended code.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Also see the [Windows Error Reporting](windows-error-reporting.md) article in this section for help with locating error codes and log files.

The following table describes some log files and how to use them for troubleshooting purposes:

|Log file |Phase: Location |Description |When to use|
|---|---|---|---|
|**setupact.log**|Downlevel:<br>$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther|Contains information about setup actions during the downlevel phase. |All downlevel failures and starting points for rollback investigations.<br> Setup.act is the most important log for diagnosing setup issues.|
|**setupact.log**|OOBE:<br>$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther\UnattendGC|Contains information about actions during the OOBE phase.|Investigating rollbacks that failed during OOBE phase and operations - 0x4001C, 0x4001D, 0x4001E, 0x4001F.|
|**setupact.log**|Rollback:<br>$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback|Contains information about actions during rollback.|Investigating generic rollbacks - 0xC1900101.|
|**setupact.log**|Pre-initialization (prior to downlevel):<br>Windows|Contains information about initializing setup.|If setup fails to launch.|
|**setupact.log**|Post-upgrade (after OOBE):<br>Windows\Panther|Contains information about setup actions during the installation.|Investigate post-upgrade related issues.|
|**setuperr.log**|Same as setupact.log|Contains information about setup errors during the installation.|Review all errors encountered during the installation phase.|
|**miglog.xml**|Post-upgrade (after OOBE):<br>Windows\Panther|Contains information about what was migrated during the installation.|Identify post upgrade data migration issues.|
|**BlueBox.log**|Downlevel:<br>Windows\Logs\Mosetup|Contains information communication between `setup.exe` and Windows Update.|Use during WSUS and Windows Update downlevel failures or for 0xC1900107.|
|Supplemental rollback logs:<br>**Setupmem.dmp**<br>**setupapi.dev.log**<br>Event logs (*.evtx)|$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback|Additional logs collected during rollback.|Setupmem.dmp: If OS bug checks during the upgrade, setup attempts to extract a mini-dump.<br>Setupapi: Device install issues - 0x30018<br>Event logs: Generic rollbacks (0xC1900101) or unexpected reboots.|

## Log entry structure

A `setupact.log` or `setuperr.log` entry includes the following elements:

1. **The date and time** - 2023-09-08 09:20:05

1. **The log level** - Info, Warning, Error, Fatal Error

1. **The logging component** - CONX, MOUPG, PANTHR, SP, IBSLIB, MIG, DISM, CSI, CBS

  The logging components SP (setup platform), MIG (migration engine), and CONX (compatibility information) are useful for troubleshooting Windows Setup errors.

1. **The message** - Operation completed successfully.

See the following example:

| Date/Time | Log level | Component | Message |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
|2023-09-08 09:23:50,|  Warning |         MIG  |   Couldn't replace object C:\Users\name\Cookies. Target Object can't be removed.|

## Analyze log files

The following instructions are meant for IT professionals. Also, see the [Upgrade error codes](/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/windows-10-upgrade-error-codes?toc=/windows/deployment/toc.json&bc=/windows/deployment/breadcrumb/toc.json) section in this guide to become familiar with [result codes](/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/windows-10-upgrade-error-codes?toc=/windows/deployment/toc.json&bc=/windows/deployment/breadcrumb/toc.json#result-codes) and [extend codes](/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/windows-10-upgrade-error-codes?toc=/windows/deployment/toc.json&bc=/windows/deployment/breadcrumb/toc.json#extend-codes).

To analyze Windows Setup log files:

1. Determine the Windows Setup error code. Windows Setup should return an error code if it isn't successful with the upgrade process.

1. Based on the [extend code](/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/windows-10-upgrade-error-codes?toc=/windows/deployment/toc.json&bc=/windows/deployment/breadcrumb/toc.json#extend-codes) portion of the error code, determine the type and location of a log file to investigate.

1. Open the log file in a text editor such as Notepad.

1. Using the [result code](/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/windows-10-upgrade-error-codes?toc=/windows/deployment/toc.json&bc=/windows/deployment/breadcrumb/toc.json#result-codes) portion of the Windows Setup error code, search for the result code in the file and find the last occurrence of the code. Alternatively, search for the "abort" and abandoning" text strings described in step 7 below.

1. To find the last occurrence of the result code:

    1. Scroll to the bottom of the file and select after the last character.
    1. Select **Edit**.
    1. Select **Find**.
    1. Type the result code.
    1. Under **Direction** select **Up**.
    1. Select **Find Next**.

1. When the last occurrence of the result code is located, scroll up a few lines from this location in the file and review the processes that failed before generating the result code.

1. Search for the following important text strings:

   - `Shell application requested abort`
   - `Abandoning apply due to error for object`

1. Decode Win32 errors that appear in this section.

1. Write down the timestamp for the observed errors in this section.

1. Search other log files for additional information matching these timestamps or errors.

For example, assume that the error code for an error is **0x8007042B - 0x2000D**. Searching for **8007042B** reveals the following content from the `setuperr.log` file:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Some lines in the following text are shortened to enhance readability. For example:
>
> - The date and time at the start of each line (ex: 2023-10-05 15:27:08) is shortened to minutes and seconds
> - The certificate file name, which is a long text string, is shortened to just "CN."

**setuperr.log** content:

```console
27:08, Error           SP     Error READ, 0x00000570 while gathering/applying object: File, C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18 [CN]. Will return 0[gle=0x00000570]
27:08, Error           MIG    Error 1392 while gathering object C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18 [CN]. Shell application requested abort![gle=0x00000570]
27:08, Error                  Gather failed. Last error: 0x00000000
27:08, Error           SP     SPDoFrameworkGather: Gather operation failed. Error: 0x0000002C
27:09, Error           SP     CMigrateFramework: Gather framework failed. Status: 44
27:09, Error           SP     Operation failed: Migrate framework (Full). Error: 0x8007042B[gle=0x000000b7]
27:09, Error           SP     Operation execution failed: 13. hr = 0x8007042B[gle=0x000000b7]
27:09, Error           SP     CSetupPlatformPrivate::Execute: Execution of operations queue failed, abandoning. Error: 0x8007042B[gle=0x000000b7]
```

The first line indicates there was an error **0x00000570** with the file **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18 [CN]**:

```console
27:08, Error           SP     Error READ, 0x00000570 while gathering/applying object: File, C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18 [CN]. Will return 0[gle=0x00000570]
```

The error **0x00000570** is a [Win32 error code](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-erref/18d8fbe8-a967-4f1c-ae50-99ca8e491d2d) corresponding to: **ERROR_FILE_CORRUPT: The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable**.

Therefore, Windows Setup failed because it couldn't migrate the corrupt file **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18\[CN]**.  This file is a local system certificate and can be safely deleted. After the `setupact.log` file is searched for more details, the phrase **Shell application requested abort** is found in a location with the same timestamp as the lines in `setuperr.log`. This analysis confirms the suspicion that this file is the cause of the upgrade failure:

This analysis indicates that the Windows upgrade error can be resolved by deleting the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18\[CN]` file.
