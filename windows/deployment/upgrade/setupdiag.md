## About SetupDiag

<I>Current downloadable version of SetupDiag: 1.6.2107.27002.</I> 
> Always be sure to run the most recent version of SetupDiag, so that can access new functionality and fixes to known issues.

SetupDiag is a diagnostic tool that can be used to obtain details about why a Windows 10 upgrade was unsuccessful. 

SetupDiag works by examining Windows Setup log files. It attempts to parse these log files to determine the root cause of a failure to update or upgrade the computer to Windows 10. SetupDiag can be run on the computer that failed to update, or you can export logs from the computer to another location and run SetupDiag in offline mode.

## SetupDiag in Windows 10, version 2004 and later

With the release of Windows 10, version 2004, SetupDiag is included with [Windows Setup](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/deployment-troubleshooting-and-log-files#windows-setup-scenario).

During the upgrade process, Windows Setup will extract all its sources files to the **%SystemDrive%\$Windows.~bt\Sources** directory. With Windows 10, version 2004 and later, **setupdiag.exe** is also installed to this directory. If there's an issue with the upgrade, SetupDiag will automatically run to determine the cause of the failure.

When run by Windows Setup, the following [parameters](#parameters) are used:

- /ZipLogs:False
- /Format:xml
- /Output:%windir%\logs\SetupDiag\SetupDiagResults.xml
- /RegPath:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\SetupDiag\Results

The resulting SetupDiag analysis can be found at **%WinDir%\Logs\SetupDiag\SetupDiagResults.xml** and in the registry under **HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\SetupDiag\Results**.  Note that the registry path isn't the same as the default registry path when SetupDiag is run manually. When SetupDiag is run manually, and the /RegPath parameter isn't specified, data is stored in the registry at HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup\Volatile\SetupDiag.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When SetupDiag indicates that there were multiple failures, the last failure in the log file is typically the fatal error, not the first one.

If the upgrade process proceeds normally, the **Sources** directory including **setupdiag.exe** is moved under **%SystemDrive%\Windows.Old** for cleanup. If the **Windows.old** directory is deleted later, **setupdiag.exe** will also be removed.

## Using SetupDiag

To quickly use SetupDiag on your current computer:
1. Verify that your system meets the [requirements](#requirements) described below. If needed, install the [.NET framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48137).
2. [Download SetupDiag](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870142).
3. If your web browser asks what to do with the file, choose **Save**. By default, the file will be saved to your **Downloads** folder. You can also save it to a different location if desired by using **Save As**.
4. When SetupDiag has finished downloading, open the folder where you downloaded the file. By default, this folder is the **Downloads** folder, which is displayed in File Explorer under **Quick access** in the left navigation pane.
5. Double-click the **SetupDiag** file to run it. Select **Yes** if you're asked to approve running the program.
    - Double-clicking the file to run it will automatically close the command window when SetupDiag has completed its analysis. If you wish to keep this window open instead, and review the messages that you see, run the program by typing **SetupDiag** at the command prompt instead of double-clicking it. You'll need to change directories to the location of SetupDiag to run it this way.
6. A command window will open while SetupDiag diagnoses your computer. Wait for this process to finish.
7. When SetupDiag finishes, two files will be created in the same folder where you double-clicked SetupDiag. One is a configuration file, the other is a log file.
8. Use Notepad to open the log file: **SetupDiagResults.log**.
9. Review the information that is displayed. If a rule was matched, this information can tell you why the computer failed to upgrade, and potentially how to fix the problem. See the [Text log sample](#text-log-sample) below.

For instructions on how to run the tool in offline mode and with more advanced options, see the [Parameters](#parameters) and [Examples](#examples) sections below.

The [Release notes](#release-notes) section at the bottom of this article has information about recent updates to this tool. 

## Requirements

1. The destination OS must be Windows 10.
2. [.NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48137) must be installed. If you aren't sure what version of .NET is currently installed, see [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed). You can also use the following command-line query to display the installed v4 versions:

    ```
    reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Net Framework Setup\NDP\v4" /s
    ```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /? | <ul><li>Displays interactive help</ul> |
| /Output:\<path to results file\> | <ul><li>This optional parameter enables you to specify the output file for results. This file is where you'll find what SetupDiag was able to determine.  Only text format output is supported.  UNC paths will work, provided the context under which SetupDiag runs has access to the UNC path.  If the path has a space in it, you must enclose the entire path in double quotes (see the example section below). <li>Default: If not specified, SetupDiag will create the file **SetupDiagResults.log** in the same  directory where SetupDiag.exe is run.</ul> |
| /LogsPath:\<Path to logs\> | <ul><li>This optional parameter tells SetupDiag.exe where to find the log files for an offline analysis. These log files can be in a flat folder format, or containing multiple subdirectories.  SetupDiag will recursively search all child directories.</ul> |
| /ZipLogs:\<True \| False\> | <ul><li>This optional parameter tells SetupDiag.exe to create a zip file containing the results and all the log files it parsed.  The zip file is created in the same directory where SetupDiag.exe is run.<li>Default: If not specified, a value of 'true' is used.</ul> |
| /Format:\<xml \| json\> | <ul><li>This optional parameter can be used to output log files in xml or JSON format.  If this parameter isn't specified, text format is used by default.</ul> |
| /Scenario:\[Recovery\] | <ul><li>This optional parameter instructs SetupDiag.exe to look for and process reset and recovery logs and ignore setup/upgrade logs.</ul>|
| /Verbose | <ul><li>This optional parameter will output much more data to a log file.  By default, SetupDiag will only produce a log file entry for serious errors.  Using **/Verbose** will cause SetupDiag to always produce another log file with debugging details. These details can be useful when reporting a problem with SetupDiag.</ul> |
| /NoTel | <ul><li>This optional parameter tells SetupDiag.exe not to send diagnostic telemetry to Microsoft.</ul> |
| /AddReg | <ul><li>This optional parameter instructs SetupDiag.exe to add failure information to the registry in offline mode. By default, SetupDiag will add failure information to the registry in online mode only. Registry data is added to the following location on the system where SetupDiag is run: **HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup\Volatile\SetupDiag**.</ul> |
| /RegPath | <ul><li>This optional parameter instructs SetupDiag.exe to add failure information to the registry using the specified path. If this parameter isn't specified the default path is **HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup\Volatile\SetupDiag**.
</ul> |

Note: The **/Mode** parameter is deprecated in version 1.4.0.0 of SetupDiag. 
- In previous versions, this command was used with the LogsPath parameter to specify that SetupDiag should run in an offline manner to analyze a set of log files that were captured from a different computer. In version 1.4.0.0, when you specify /LogsPath then SetupDiag will automatically run in offline mode, therefore the /Mode parameter isn't needed.

### Examples:

In the following example, SetupDiag is run with default parameters (online mode, results file is SetupDiagResults.log in the same folder where SetupDiag is run).

```
SetupDiag.exe
```

In the following example, SetupDiag is run in online mode (this mode is the default).  It will know where to look for logs on the current (failing) system, so there's no need to gather logs ahead of time. A custom location for results is specified.

```
SetupDiag.exe /Output:C:\SetupDiag\Results.log
```

The following example uses the /Output parameter to save results to a path name that contains a space:

```
SetupDiag /Output:"C:\Tools\SetupDiag\SetupDiag Results\Results.log"
```

The following example specifies that SetupDiag is to run in offline mode, and to process the log files found in **D:\Temp\Logs\LogSet1**.

```
SetupDiag.exe /Output:C:\SetupDiag\Results.log /LogsPath:D:\Temp\Logs\LogSet1
```

The following example sets recovery scenario in offline mode. In the example, SetupDiag will search for reset/recovery logs in the specified LogsPath location and output the results to the directory specified by the /Output parameter.

```
SetupDiag.exe /Output:C:\SetupDiag\RecoveryResults.log /LogsPath:D:\Temp\Cabs\PBR_Log /Scenario:Recovery
```

The following example sets recovery scenario in online mode. In the example, SetupDiag will search for reset/recovery logs on the current system and output results in XML format.

```
SetupDiag.exe /Scenario:Recovery /Format:xml
```


## Log files

[Windows Setup Log Files and Event Logs](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-setup-log-files-and-event-logs) has information about where logs are created during Windows Setup. For offline processing, you should run SetupDiag against the contents of the entire folder. For example, depending on when the upgrade failed, copy one of the following folders to your offline location:

\\$Windows.~bt\sources\panther
<br>\\$Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback
<br>\Windows\Panther
<br>\Windows\Panther\NewOS

If you copy the parent folder and all subfolders, SetupDiag will automatically search for log files in all subdirectories.

## Setup bug check analysis

When Microsoft Windows encounters a condition that compromises safe system operation, the system halts. This condition is called a bug check. It's also commonly referred to as a system crash, a kernel error, a Stop error, or BSOD. Typically a hardware device, hardware driver, or related software causes this error.

If crash dumps [are enabled](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/enabling-a-kernel-mode-dump-file) on the system, a crash dump file is created. If the bug check occurs during an upgrade, Windows Setup will extract a minidump (setupmem.dmp) file. SetupDiag can also debug these setup-related minidumps.

To debug a setup-related bug check, you must:
- Specify the **/LogsPath** parameter. You can't debug memory dumps in online mode. 
- Gather the setup memory dump file (setupmem.dmp) from the failing system. 
    - Setupmem.dmp will be created in either **%SystemDrive%\$Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback**, or in **%WinDir%\Panther\NewOS\Rollback** depending on when the bug check occurs.
- Install the [Windows Debugging Tools](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools) on the computer that runs SetupDiag.

In the following example, the **setupmem.dmp** file is copied to the **D:\Dump** directory and the Windows Debugging Tools are installed prior to running SetupDiag:

```
SetupDiag.exe /Output:C:\SetupDiag\Dumpdebug.log /LogsPath:D:\Dump
```

## Known issues

1. Some rules can take a long time to process if the log files involved are large.

## Rules

When searching log files, SetupDiag uses a set of rules to match known issues. These rules are contained in the rules.xml file that is extracted when SetupDiag is run. The rules.xml file might be updated as new versions of SetupDiag are made available. For more information, see the [release notes](#release-notes) section.

Each rule name and its associated unique rule identifier are listed with a description of the known upgrade-blocking issue. In the rule descriptions, the term "down-level" refers to the first phase of the upgrade process, which runs under the starting OS.

1. CompatScanOnly - FFDAFD37-DB75-498A-A893-472D49A1311D
    - This rule indicates that `setup.exe` was called with a specific command line parameter that indicated setup was to do a compat scan only, not an upgrade.
2. BitLockerHardblock - C30152E2-938E-44B8-915B-D1181BA635AE
    - This is an upgrade block when the target OS doesn't support BitLocker, yet the host OS has BitLocker enabled.
3. VHDHardblock - D9ED1B82-4ED8-4DFD-8EC0-BE69048978CC
    - This block happens when the host OS is booted to a VHD image.  Upgrade isn't supported when the host OS is booted from a VHD image.
4. PortableWorkspaceHardblock - 5B0D3AB4-212A-4CE4-BDB9-37CA404BB280
    - This indicates that the host OS is booted from a Windows To-Go device (USB key).  Upgrade isn't supported in the Windows To-Go environment.
5. AuditModeHardblock - A03BD71B-487B-4ACA-83A0-735B0F3F1A90
    - This block indicates that the host OS is currently booted into Audit Mode, a special mode for modifying the Windows state.  Upgrade isn't supported from this state.
6. SafeModeHardblock - 404D9523-B7A8-4203-90AF-5FBB05B6579B
    - This block indicates that the host OS is booted to Safe Mode, where upgrade isn't supported.
7. InsufficientSystemPartitionDiskSpaceHardblock - 3789FBF8-E177-437D-B1E3-D38B4C4269D1
    - This block is encountered when setup determines the system partition (where the boot loader files are stored) doesn't have enough space to be serviced with the newer boot files required during the upgrade process.
8. CompatBlockedApplicationAutoUninstall - BEBA5BC6-6150-413E-8ACE-5E1EC8D34DD5
    - This rule indicates there's an application that needs to be uninstalled before setup can continue.
9. CompatBlockedApplicationDismissable - EA52620B-E6A0-4BBC-882E-0686605736D9
    - When running setup in /quiet mode, there are dismissible application messages that turn into blocks unless the command line also specifies "/compat ignorewarning".  This rule indicates setup was executed in /quiet mode but there's an application dismissible block message that has prevented setup from continuing.
10. CompatBlockedApplicationManualUninstall - 9E912E5F-25A5-4FC0-BEC1-CA0EA5432FF4
    - This rule indicates that an application without an Add/Remove Programs entry, is present on the system and blocking setup from continuing.  This typically requires manual removal of the files associated with this application to continue.
11. HardblockDeviceOrDriver - ED3AEFA1-F3E2-4F33-8A21-184ADF215B1B
    - This error indicates a device driver that is loaded on the host OS isn't compatible with the newer OS version and needs to be removed prior to the upgrade.
12. HardblockMismatchedLanguage - 60BA8449-CF23-4D92-A108-D6FCEFB95B45
    - This rule indicates the host OS and the target OS language editions don't match.
13. HardblockFlightSigning - 598F2802-3E7F-4697-BD18-7A6371C8B2F8
    - This rule indicates the target OS is a pre-release, Windows Insider build, and the target machine has Secure Boot enabled.  This will block the pre-release signed build from booting if installed on the machine.
14. DiskSpaceBlockInDownLevel - 6080AFAC-892E-4903-94EA-7A17E69E549E
    - This failure indicates the system ran out of disk space during the down-level operations of upgrade.
15. DiskSpaceFailure - 981DCBA5-B8D0-4BA7-A8AB-4030F7A10191

## Release notes

07/27/2021 - SetupDiag v1.6.2107.27002 is released with 61 rules, as a standalone tool available in the Download Center.
- This version contains compliance updates and minor bug fixes.
- With this release and subsequent releases, the version number of the downloadable SetupDiag tool is different from the one included with Windows Setup.

05/06/2021 - SetupDiag v1.6.1.0 is released with 61 rules, as a standalone tool available in the Download Center.  
- This version of SetupDiag is included with Windows 10, version 21H1.
- A new rule is added: UserProfileSuffixMismatch.
- All outputs to the command line are now invariant culture for purposes of time/date format
- Fixed an issue with registry output in which the "no match found" result caused a corrupted REG_SZ value.

08/08/2019 - SetupDiag v1.6.0.42 is released with 60 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
 - Log detection performance is improved.  Log detection takes around 10 seconds or less where before it could take up to a minute.
 - Added Setup Operation and Setup Phase information to both the results log and the registry information.
     - This is the last Operation and Phase that Setup was in when the failure occurred.
 - Added detailed Setup Operation and Setup Phase information (and timing) to output log when /verbose is specified.
     - Note, if the issue found is a compat block, no Setup Operation or Phase info exists yet and therefore won't be available.
 - Added more info to the Registry output. 
     - Detailed 'FailureData' info where available.  Example: "AppName = MyBlockedApplication" or "DiskSpace = 6603" (in MB)
         - "Key = Value" data specific to the failure found.
     - Added 'UpgradeStartTime', 'UpgradeEndTime' and 'UpgradeElapsedTime'
     - Added 'SetupDiagVersion', 'DateTime' (to indicate when SetupDiag was executed on the system), 'TargetOSVersion', 'HostOSVersion' and more…


06/19/2019 - SetupDiag v1.5.0.0 is released with 60 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- All date and time outputs are updated to localized format per user request.
- Added setup Operation and Phase information to /verbose log.
- Added last Setup Operation and last Setup Phase information to most rules where it makes sense (see new output below).
- Performance improvement in searching setupact.logs to determine correct log to parse.
- Added SetupDiag version number to text report (xml and json always had it).
- Added "no match" reports for xml and json per user request.
- Formatted Json output for easy readability.
- Performance improvements when searching for setup logs; this should be much faster now.
- Added seven new rules: PlugInComplianceBlock, PreReleaseWimMountDriverFound, WinSetupBootFilterFailure, WimMountDriverIssue, DISMImageSessionFailure, FindEarlyDownlevelError, and FindSPFatalError. See the [Rules](#rules) section above for more information.
- Diagnostic information is now output to the registry at **HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup\Volatile\SetupDiag**
  - The **/AddReg** command was added to toggle registry output. This setting is off by default for offline mode, and on by default for online mode. The command has no effect for online mode and enables registry output for offline mode.
  - This registry key is deleted as soon as SetupDiag is run a second time, and replaced with current data, so it's always up to date.
  - This registry key also gets deleted when a new update instance is invoked.
  - For an example, see [Sample registry key](#sample-registry-key).

05/17/2019 - SetupDiag v1.4.1.0 is released with 53 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- This release dds the ability to find and diagnose reset and recovery failures (Push-Button Reset).  

12/18/2018 - SetupDiag v1.4.0.0 is released with 53 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- This release includes major improvements in rule processing performance: ~3x faster rule processing performance!
  - The FindDownlevelFailure rule is up to 10 times faster.
- New rules have been added to analyze failures upgrading to Windows 10 version 1809.
- A new help link is available for resolving servicing stack failures on the down-level OS when the rule match indicates this type of failure.
- Removed the need to specify /Mode parameter. Now if you specify /LogsPath, it automatically assumes offline mode.
- Some functional and output improvements were made for several rules.

07/16/2018 - SetupDiag v1.3.1 is released with 44 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- This release fixes a problem that can occur when running SetupDiag in online mode on a computer that produces a setupmem.dmp file, but doesn't have debugger binaries installed.

07/10/2018 - SetupDiag v1.30 is released with 44 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- Bug fix for an over-matched plug-in rule. The rule will now correctly match only critical (setup failure) plug-in issues.
- New feature: Ability to output logs in JSON and XML format.
  - Use "/Format:xml" or "/Format:json" command line parameters to specify the new output format. See [sample logs](#sample-logs) at the bottom of this topic.
  - If the "/Format:xml" or "/Format:json" parameter is omitted, the log output format will default to text.
- New Feature: Where possible, specific instructions are now provided in rule output to repair the identified error. For example, instructions are provided to remediate known blocking issues such as uninstalling an incompatible app or freeing up space on the system drive.
- Three new rules added: AdvancedInstallerFailed, MigrationAbortedDueToPluginFailure, DISMAddPackageFailed.

05/30/2018 - SetupDiag v1.20 is released with 41 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- Fixed a bug in device install failure detection in online mode.
- Changed SetupDiag to work without an instance of setupact.log. Previously, SetupDiag required at least one setupact.log to operate.  This change enables the tool to analyze update failures that occur prior to calling SetupHost.
- Telemetry is refactored to only send the rule name and GUID (or "NoRuleMatched" if no rule is matched) and the Setup360 ReportId. This change assures data privacy during rule processing.

05/02/2018 - SetupDiag v1.10 is released with 34 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
- A performance enhancement has been added to result in faster rule processing.
- Rules output now includes links to support articles, if applicable.
- SetupDiag now provides the path and name of files that it's processing.
- You can now run SetupDiag by selecting it and then examining the output log file.
- An output log file is now always created, whether or not a rule was matched.

03/30/2018 - SetupDiag v1.00 is released with 26 rules, as a standalone tool available from the Download Center.
