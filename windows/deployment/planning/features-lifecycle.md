## Terminology

The following terms can be used to describe the status that might be assigned to a feature during its lifecycle. 

- **Deprecation**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a feature or functionality is no longer in active development and may be removed in future releases of a product or online service.
- **End of support**: The stage of the product lifecycle when support and servicing are no longer available for a product.
- **Retirement**: The stage of the product lifecycle when an online service is shut down so that it is no longer available for use.
- **Remove or retire a feature**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a feature or functionality is removed from an online service after it has been deprecated.
- **Replace a feature**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a feature or functionality in an online service is replaced with a different feature or functionality.
