  - name: Drivers and compatibility
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where can I find drivers for my devices for Windows 10 Enterprise?
        answer: |
          For many devices, drivers will be automatically installed in Windows 10 and there will be no need for further action.
          - For some devices, Windows 10 may be unable to install drivers that are required for operation. If your device drivers aren't automatically installed, visit the manufacturer's support website for your device to download and manually install the drivers. If Windows 10 drivers aren't available, the most up-to-date drivers for Windows 8.1 will often work in Windows 10.
          - For some devices, the manufacturer may provide more up-to-date drivers or drivers that enable more functionality than the drivers installed by Windows 10. Always follow the recommendations of the device manufacturer for optimal performance and stability.
          - Some computer manufacturers provide packs of drivers for easy implementation in management and deployment solutions like the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. These driver packs contain all of the drivers needed for each device and can greatly simplify the process of deploying Windows to a new make or model of computer. Driver packs for some common manufacturers include:
              - [HP driver pack](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/ads/clientmanagement/drivers-pack.html)
              - [Dell driver packs for enterprise client OS deployment](http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2065.dell-command-deploy-driver-packs-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment)
              - [Lenovo Configuration Manager and MDT package index](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht074984)
              - [Panasonic Driver Pack for Enterprise](http://pc-dl.panasonic.co.jp/itn/drivers/driver_packages.html)
          
      - question: |
          Where can I find out if an application or device is compatible with Windows 10?
        answer: |
          Many existing Win32 and Win64 applications already run reliably on Windows 10 without any changes. You can also expect strong compatibility and support for Web apps and devices.
          
      - question: |
          Is there an easy way to assess if my organization's devices are ready to upgrade to Windows 10?
        answer: |
          [Desktop Analytics](/mem/configmgr/desktop-analytics/overview) provides powerful insights and recommendations about the computers, applications, and drivers in your organization, at no extra cost and without other infrastructure requirements. This service guides you through your upgrade and feature update projects using a workflow based on Microsoft recommended practices. Up-to-date inventory data allows you to balance cost and risk in your upgrade projects.

      - question: |
          Can I upgrade computers from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 without deploying a new image?
        answer: |
          Computers running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 can be upgraded directly to Windows 10 through the in-place upgrade process without a need to reimage the device using MDT and/or Configuration Manager. For more information, see [Upgrade to Windows 10 with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](../deploy-windows-cm/upgrade-to-windows-10-with-configuration-manager.md) or [Upgrade to Windows 10 with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](../deploy-windows-mdt/upgrade-to-windows-10-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can I upgrade from Windows 7 Enterprise or Windows 8.1 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise for free?
        answer: |
          If you have Windows 7 Enterprise or Windows 8.1 Enterprise and current Windows 10 Enterprise E3 or E5 subscription, you're entitled to the upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise through the rights of Software Assurance. You can find your product keys and installation media at the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).
          
          For devices that are licensed under a volume license agreement for Windows that doesn't include Software Assurance, new licenses will be required to upgrade these devices to Windows 10.
          
  - name: Managing updates
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is Windows as a service?
        answer: |
          The Windows 10 operating system introduces a new way to build, deploy, and service Windows: Windows as a service. Microsoft has reimagined each part of the process, to simplify the lives of IT pros and maintain a consistent Windows 10 experience for its customers. These improvements focus on maximizing customer involvement in Windows development, simplifying the deployment and servicing of Windows client computers, and leveling out the resources needed to deploy and maintain Windows over time. For more information, see [Overview of Windows as a service](../update/waas-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          How is servicing different with Windows as a service?
        answer: |
          Traditional Windows servicing has included several release types: major revisions (for example, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7 operating systems), service packs, and monthly updates. With Windows 10, there are two release types: feature updates that add new functionality two to three times per year, and quality updates that provide security and reliability fixes at least once a month.
          
      - question: |
          What are the servicing channels?
        answer: |
          To align with the new method of delivering feature updates and quality updates in Windows 10, Microsoft introduced the concept of servicing channels to allow customers to designate how aggressively their individual devices are updated. For example, an organization may have test devices that the IT department can update with new features as soon as possible, and then specialized devices that require a longer feature update cycle to ensure continuity. With that in mind, Microsoft offers two servicing channels for Windows 10: General Availability Channel, and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For details about the versions in each servicing channel, see [Windows 10 release information](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows/release-info.aspx). For more information on each channel, see [servicing channels](../update/waas-overview.md#servicing-channels).
          
      - question: |
          What tools can I use to manage Windows as a service updates?
        answer: |
          There are many available tools:
          - Windows Update
          - Windows Update for Business
          - Windows Server Update Services
          - Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
          
          For more information, see [Servicing Tools](../update/waas-overview.md#servicing-tools).

      - question: |
          How will people in my organization adjust to using Windows 10 Enterprise after upgrading from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1?
        answer: |
          Windows 10 combines the best aspects of the user experience from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 to make using Windows simple and straightforward. Users of Windows 7 will find the Start menu in the same location as they always have. In the same place, users of Windows 8.1 will find the live tiles from their Start screen, accessible by the Start button in the same way as they were accessed in Windows 8.1.
          
      - question: |
          How does Windows 10 help people work with applications and data across various devices?
        answer: |
          The desktop experience in Windows 10 has been improved to provide a better experience for people that use a traditional mouse and keyboard. Key changes include:
          - Start menu is a launching point for access to apps.
          - Universal apps now open in windows instead of full screen.
          - [Multitasking is improved with adjustable Snap](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2015/06/04/arrange-your-windows-in-a-snap/), which allows you to have more than two windows side-by-side on the same screen and to customize how those windows are arranged.
          - Tablet Mode to simplify using Windows with a finger or pen by using touch input.
