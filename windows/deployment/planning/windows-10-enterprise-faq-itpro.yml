          What are the system requirements?
        answer: |
          For details, see [Windows 10 Enterprise system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/Windows-10-specifications#areaheading-uid09f4).

      - question: |
          What are the hardware requirements for Windows 10?
        answer: |
          Most computers that are compatible with Windows 8.1 will be compatible with Windows 10. You may need to install updated drivers in Windows 10 for your devices to properly function. For more information, see [Windows 10 specifications](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).

      - question: |
          Can I evaluate Windows 10 Enterprise?
        answer: |
          Yes, a 90-day evaluation of Windows 10 Enterprise is available through the [Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise). The evaluation is available in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain, International Sort).

  - name: Drivers and compatibility
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where can I find drivers for my devices for Windows 10 Enterprise?
        answer: |
          For many devices, drivers will be automatically installed in Windows 10 and there will be no need for further action.
          - For some devices, Windows 10 may be unable to install drivers that are required for operation. If your device drivers aren't automatically installed, visit the manufacturer's support website for your device to download and manually install the drivers. If Windows 10 drivers aren't available, the most up-to-date drivers for Windows 8.1 will often work in Windows 10.
          - For some devices, the manufacturer may provide more up-to-date drivers or drivers that enable more functionality than the drivers installed by Windows 10. Always follow the recommendations of the device manufacturer for optimal performance and stability.
          - Some computer manufacturers provide packs of drivers for easy implementation in management and deployment solutions like the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) or Microsoft Configuration Manager. These driver packs contain all of the drivers needed for each device and can greatly simplify the process of deploying Windows to a new make or model of computer. Driver packs for some common manufacturers include:
              - [HP driver pack](https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/client-management-solutions/drivers-pack.html)
              - [Dell driver packs for enterprise client OS deployment](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000124139/dell-command-deploy-driver-packs-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment)
              - [Lenovo Configuration Manager and MDT package index](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht074984)
              - [Panasonic Driver Pack for Enterprise](https://pc-dl.panasonic.co.jp/itn/drivers/driver_packages.html)

      - question: |
          Where can I find out if an application or device is compatible with Windows 10?
        answer: |
          Many existing Win32 and Win64 applications already run reliably on Windows 10 without any changes. You can also expect strong compatibility and support for Web apps and devices.

  - name: Administration and deployment
    questions:
      - question: |
          Which deployment tools support Windows 10?
        answer: |
          Updated versions of Microsoft deployment tools, including Microsoft Configuration Manager, MDT, and the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) support Windows 10.

          - [Microsoft Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr) simplifies the deployment and management of Windows 10. If you aren't currently using it, download a free 180-day trial of [Microsoft Configuration Manager (current branch)](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-microsoft-endpoint-configuration-manager).

          - [MDT](/mem/configmgr/mdt) is a collection of tools, processes, and guidance for automating desktop and server deployment.

          - The [Windows ADK](/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install) has tools that allow you to customize Windows images for large-scale deployment, and test system quality and performance. You can download the latest version of the Windows ADK for Windows 10 from the Hardware Dev Center.

      - question: |
          Can I upgrade computers from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 without deploying a new image?
        answer: |
          Computers running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 can be upgraded directly to Windows 10 through the in-place upgrade process without a need to reimage the device. For more information, see [Upgrade to Windows 10 with Microsoft Configuration Manager](../deploy-windows-cm/upgrade-to-windows-10-with-configuration-manager.md).

      - question: |
          Can I upgrade from Windows 7 Enterprise or Windows 8.1 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise for free?
        answer: |
          If you have Windows 7 Enterprise or Windows 8.1 Enterprise and current Windows 10 Enterprise E3 or E5 subscription, you're entitled to the upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise through the rights of Software Assurance. You can find your product keys and installation media at the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

          For devices that are licensed under a volume license agreement for Windows that doesn't include Software Assurance, new licenses will be required to upgrade these devices to Windows 10.

  - name: Managing updates
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is Windows as a service?
        answer: |
          The Windows 10 operating system introduces a new way to build, deploy, and service Windows: Windows as a service. Microsoft has reimagined each part of the process, to simplify the lives of IT pros and maintain a consistent Windows 10 experience for its customers. These improvements focus on maximizing customer involvement in Windows development, simplifying the deployment and servicing of Windows client computers, and leveling out the resources needed to deploy and maintain Windows over time. For more information, see [Overview of Windows as a service](../update/waas-overview.md).

      - question: |
          How is servicing different with Windows as a service?
        answer: |
          Traditional Windows servicing has included several release types: major revisions (for example, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7 operating systems), service packs, and monthly updates. With Windows 10, there are two release types: feature updates that add new functionality two to three times per year, and quality updates that provide security and reliability fixes at least once a month.

      - question: |
          What are the servicing channels?
        answer: |
          To align with the new method of delivering feature updates and quality updates in Windows 10, Microsoft introduced the concept of servicing channels to allow customers to designate how aggressively their individual devices are updated. For example, an organization may have test devices that the IT department can update with new features as soon as possible, and then specialized devices that require a longer feature update cycle to ensure continuity. With that in mind, Microsoft offers two servicing channels for Windows 10: General Availability Channel, and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For details about the versions in each servicing channel, see [Windows 10 release information](/windows/release-health/release-information). For more information on each channel, see [servicing channels](../update/waas-overview.md#servicing-channels).

      - question: |
          What tools can I use to manage Windows as a service updates?
        answer: |
          There are many available tools:
          - Windows Update
          - Windows Update for Business
          - Windows Server Update Services
          - Microsoft Configuration Manager

          For more information, see [Servicing Tools](../update/waas-overview.md#servicing-tools).

      - question: |
          How will people in my organization adjust to using Windows 10 Enterprise after upgrading from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1?
        answer: |
          Windows 10 combines the best aspects of the user experience from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 to make using Windows simple and straightforward. Users of Windows 7 will find the Start menu in the same location as they always have. In the same place, users of Windows 8.1 will find the live tiles from their Start screen, accessible by the Start button in the same way as they were accessed in Windows 8.1.

      - question: |
          How does Windows 10 help people work with applications and data across various devices?
        answer: |
          The desktop experience in Windows 10 has been improved to provide a better experience for people that use a traditional mouse and keyboard. Key changes include:
          - Start menu is a launching point for access to apps.
          - Universal apps now open in windows instead of full screen.
          - [Multitasking is improved with adjustable Snap](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2015/06/04/arrange-your-windows-in-a-snap/), which allows you to have more than two windows side-by-side on the same screen and to customize how those windows are arranged.
          - Tablet Mode to simplify using Windows with a finger or pen by using touch input.
