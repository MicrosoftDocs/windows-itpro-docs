# Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) Technical Reference


**Applies to**
- Windows 10, version 1607
 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>We've replaced the majority of functionality included in the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) with [Windows Analytics](/mem/configmgr/desktop-analytics/overview), a solution in the Microsoft Operations Management Suite. Windows Analytics gives enterprises the tools to plan and manage the upgrade process end to end, allowing them to adopt new Windows releases more quickly. With new Windows versions being released multiple times a year, ensuring application and driver compatibility on an ongoing basis is key to adopting new Windows versions as they are released.

Microsoft developed Windows Analytics in response to demand from enterprise customers looking for additional direction and details about upgrading to Windows 10. Windows Analytics was built taking into account multiple channels of customer feedback, testing, and Microsoft's experience upgrading millions of devices to Windows 10. 

With Windows diagnostic data enabled, Windows Analytics collects system, application, and driver data for analysis. We then identify compatibility issues that can block an upgrade and suggest fixes when they are known to Microsoft. 

Use Windows Analytics to get:
- A visual workflow that guides you from pilot to production
- Detailed computer and application inventory
- Powerful computer level search and drill-downs 
- Guidance and insights into application and driver compatibility issues, with suggested fixes 
- Data driven application rationalization tools
- Application usage information, allowing targeted validation; workflow to track validation progress and decisions
- Data export to commonly used software deployment tools, including Microsoft Configuration Manager

The Windows Analytics workflow steps you through the discovery and rationalization process until you have a list of computers that are ready to be upgraded.

At the same time, we've kept the Standard User Analyzer tool, which helps you test your apps and to monitor API calls for potential compatibility issues, and the Compatibility Administrator, which helps you to resolve potential compatibility issues.
