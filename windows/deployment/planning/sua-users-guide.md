You can use Standard User Analyzer (SUA) to test your applications and monitor API calls to detect compatibility issues related to the User Account Control (UAC) feature in Windows.

You can use SUA in either of the following ways:

-   **Standard User Analyzer Tool.** A full-function tool in which you can perform in-depth analysis and fix issues.
