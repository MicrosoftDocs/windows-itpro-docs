# Windows Autopilot EULA dismissal – important information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information below isn't the EULA. It is a notice of awareness to the administrator that's configuring to skip End User License Agreement (EULA) during the OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience).

Using this tool allows you to configure individual installations of Windows on devices managed by your organization. You may choose to suppress or hide certain set-up screens that are normally presented to users when setting up Windows, including the EULA acceptance screen.  

By using this function, you agree that suppressing or hiding any screens that are designed to provide users with notice or acceptance of terms means that you, on behalf of your organization or the individual user as the case may be, have consented to the notices and accepted the applicable terms. This consent includes your agreement to the terms and conditions of the license or notice that would be presented to the user if you didn't suppress or hide it using this tool. You and your users may not use the Windows software on those devices if you haven't validly acquired a license for the software from Microsoft or its licensed distributors.
