# Windows Update for Business reports workbook
<!-- MAX6325272, OS33771278 -->
***(Applies to: Windows 11 & Windows 10)***


[Windows Update for Business reports](wufb-reports-overview.md) presents information commonly needed by updates administrators in an easy-to-use format. Windows Update for Business reports uses [Azure Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-getting-started) to give you a visual representation of your compliance data. The workbook is broken down into tab sections:

- [Summary](#summary-tab)
- [Quality updates](#quality-updates-tab)
- [Feature updates](#feature-updates-tab)
- [Delivery Optimization](#bkmk_do)
- [Driver updates](#driver-updates-tab)

## Open the Windows Update for Business reports workbook

To access the Windows Update for Business reports workbook:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Monitor** > **Workbooks** from the menu bar.
   - You can also type **Monitor** in the search bar. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.

1. When the gallery opens, select the **Windows Update for Business reports** workbook. If needed, you can filter workbooks by name in the gallery.
1. When the workbook opens, you may need to specify which **Subscription** and **Workspace** you used when [enabling Windows Update for Business reports](wufb-reports-enable.md).

## Summary tab

The **Summary** tab gives you a brief high-level overview of the devices that you've enrolled into Windows Update for Business reports.  The **Summary** tab contains tiles above the **Overall security update status** chart.

### Summary tab tiles

Each of these tiles contains an option to **View details**. When **View details** is selected for a tile, a flyout appears with additional information.

:::image type="content" source="media/33771278-workbook-summary-tab-tiles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the summary tab tiles in the Windows Update for Business reports workbook":::

| Tile name | Description | View details description |
|---|---|------|
| **Enrolled devices** | Total number of devices that are enrolled into Windows Update for Business reports | Displays multiple charts about the operating systems (OS) for enrolled devices: </br> **OS Version** </br> **OS Edition** </br> **OS Servicing Channel** </br> **OS Architecture**|
|**Active alerts** | Total number of active alerts on enrolled devices | Displays the top three active alert subtypes and the count of devices in each. </br> </br> Select the count of **Devices** to display a table of the devices. This table is limited to the first 250 rows. Select `...` to export the full list, or display the query in [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). </br> </br> Select an **AlertSubtype** to display a list containing: </br> - Each **Error Code** in the alert subtype </br>- A **Description** of the error code </br> - A **Recommendation** to help you remediate the error code </br> - A count of **Devices** with the specific error code |
|  **Windows 11 eligibility** | Percentage of devices that are capable of running Windows 11 | Displays the following items: </br> - **Windows 11 Readiness Status** chart </br> - **Readiness Reason(s) Breakdown** chart that displays  Windows 11 requirements that aren't met. </br> - A table for **Readiness reason**. Select a reason to display a list of devices that don't meet a specific requirement for Windows 11. |

### Summary tab charts

The charts displayed in the **Summary** tab give you a general idea of the overall status of your devices. The two charts displayed include:

- **Overall security update status**: Gives you general insight into of the current update compliance state of your enrolled devices. For instance, if the chart shows a large number of devices are missing multiple security updates, it may indicate an issue in the software update process.

- **Feature update status**: Gives you a general understanding of how many devices are eligible for feature updates based on the operating system lifecycle.

## Quality updates tab

The **Quality updates** tab displays generalized data at the top by using tiles. The quality update data becomes more specific as you navigate lower in this tab. The top of the **Quality updates** tab contains tiles with the following information:

- **Latest security update**: Count of devices that have reported successful installation of the latest security update.
- **Missing one security update**: Count of devices that haven't installed the latest security update.
- **Missing multiple security updates**: Count of devices that are missing two or more security updates.
- **Active alerts**: Count of active update and device alerts for quality updates.

Selecting **View details** on any of the tiles displays a flyout with a chart that displays the first 250 items. Select `...` from the flyout to export the full list, or display the query in [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial).


Below the tiles, the **Quality updates** tab is subdivided into **Update status** and **Device status** groups. These different chart groups allow you to easily discover trends in compliance data. For instance, you may remember that about third of your devices were in the installing state yesterday, but this number didn't change as much as you were expecting. That unexpected trend may cause you to investigate and resolve a potential issue before end users are impacted.

## Customize the workbook

Since the Windows Update for Business reports workbook is an [Azure Workbook template](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-templates), it can be customized to suit your needs. If you open a template, make some adjustments, and save it, the template is saved as a workbook. This workbook appears in green. The original template is left untouched. For more information about workbooks, see [Get started with Azure Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-getting-started).
