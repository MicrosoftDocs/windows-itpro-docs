# WaaSInsiderStatus

<!--Using include for recommending Windows Update for Business reports for all Update Compliance v1 docs-->
[!INCLUDE [Recommend Windows Update for Business reports](./includes/wufb-reports-recommend.md)]

WaaSInsiderStatus records contain device-centric data and acts as the device record for devices on Windows Insider Program builds in Update Compliance. Each record provided in daily snapshots maps to a single device in a single tenant. This table has data such as the current device's installed version of Windows, whether it is on the latest available updates, and whether the device needs attention. Insider devices have fewer fields than [WaaSUpdateStatus](update-compliance-schema-waasupdatestatus.md).


|Field |Type |Example |Description |
|--|--|---|--|
|**Computer** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`JohnPC-Contoso` |User or Organization-provided device name. If this value appears as '#', then Device Name may not be sent through telemetry. To enable Device Name to be sent with telemetry, see [Enabling Device Name in Telemetry](./update-compliance-get-started.md). |
|**ComputerID** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`g:6755412281299915` |Microsoft Global Device Identifier. This value is an internal identifier used by Microsoft. A connection to the end-user managed service account is required for this identifier to be populated; no device data will be present in Update Compliance without this identifier. |
|**OSArchitecture** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`amd64` |The architecture of the Operating System. |
|**OSName** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`Windows 10` |The name of the Operating System. This value will always be Windows 10 for Update Compliance. |
|**OSVersion** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`1909` |The version of Windows 10. This value typically is of the format of the year of the version's release, following the month. In this example, `1909` corresponds to 2019-09 (September). This value maps to the `Major` portion of OSBuild. |
|**OSBuild** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`18363.720` |The currently installed Windows 10 Build, in the format `Major`.`Revision`. `Major` corresponds to which Feature Update the device is on, whereas `Revision` corresponds to which quality update the device is on. Mappings between Feature release and Major, as well as Revision and KBs, are available at [aka.ms/win10releaseinfo](/windows/release-health/release-information). |
|**OSRevisionNumber** |[int](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/int) |`720` |An integer value for the revision number of the currently installed Windows 10 OSBuild on the device. |
|**OSEdition** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`Enterprise` |The Windows 10 Edition or SKU. |
|**OSFamily** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`Windows.Desktop` |The Device Family of the device. Only `Windows.Desktop` is currently supported. |
|**OSServicingBranch** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`Semi-Annual` |The Servicing Branch or [Servicing Channel](./waas-overview.md#servicing-channels) the device is on. Dictates which Windows updates the device receives and the cadence of those updates. |
|**TimeGenerated** |[datetime](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/datetime)|3/22/`2020, 1:00:01.318 PM`|A DateTime corresponding to the moment Azure Monitor Logs ingested this record to your Log Analytics workspace. |
|**LastScan** |[datetime](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/datetime)|3/22/`2020, 2:00:00.436 AM`|A DateTime corresponding to the last time the device sent data to Microsoft. This value does not necessarily mean all data that is needed to populate all fields Update Compliance uses was sent; this value is more like a "heartbeat". |
