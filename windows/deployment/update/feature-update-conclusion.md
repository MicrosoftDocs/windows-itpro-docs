# Conclusion

**Applies to**: Windows 10

Mission critical devices that need to be online 24x7 pose unique challenges for the IT Pro looking to stay current with the latest Windows 10 feature update. Because these devices are online continually, providing mission critical services, with only a small window of time available to apply feature updates, specific procedures are required to effectively keep these devices current, with as little downtime as possible. 

Whether you have defined servicing windows at your disposal where feature updates can be installed automatically, or you require user initiated installs by a technician, this whitepaper provides guidelines for either approach. Improvements are continually being made to Windows 10 setup to reduce device offline time for feature updates. This whitepaper will be updated as enhancements become available to improve the overall servicing approach and experience.
