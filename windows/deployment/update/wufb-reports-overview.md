## Limitations

Windows Update for Business reports is a Windows service hosted in Azure that uses Windows diagnostic data. You should be aware that Windows Update for Business reports doesn't meet [US Government community compliance (GCC)](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc#us-government-community-compliance) requirements. For a list of GCC offerings for Microsoft products and services, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home). Windows Update for Business reports is available in the Azure Commercial cloud, but not available for GCC High or United States Department of Defense customers.


## How Windows Update for Business reports works

You'll set up Windows Update for Business reports by enrolling into the service from the Azure portal. Then you'll configure your Azure AD-joined devices to send Windows client diagnostic data to the service. Windows Update for Business reports uses [Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) to store the diagnostic data the clients send. You can use this data for reporting on updates for your devices. Windows Update for Business reports collects system data such as:

- Update deployment progress
- Delivery Optimization usage data
- Windows Update for Business configuration data

The Azure Log Analytics ingestion and retention charges aren't incurred on your Azure subscription for Windows Update for Business reports data. You also choose an [Azure Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) that you own for your client diagnostic data. The collected diagnostic data populates the Windows Update for Business reports tables so you can easily query your data.

## Use your Windows Update for Business reports data

Since the data from your clients is stored in a Log Analytics workspace, you can go beyond the standard reports to analyze and display your data in multiple ways. Some of the ways you could display your data include:

- Using the data in [custom workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview) that you create
- Building [custom Kusto (KQL) queries](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview)
- Developing your own custom views by integrating the [Log Analytics data](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards) into other tools such as:
   - [Operations Management Suite](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/om-agents)
   - [Power BI](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi)
   - Other tools for [querying the data](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview)
