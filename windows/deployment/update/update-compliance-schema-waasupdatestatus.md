# WaaSUpdateStatus

<!--Using include for recommending Windows Update for Business reports for all Update Compliance v1 docs-->
[!INCLUDE [Recommend Windows Update for Business reports](./includes/wufb-reports-recommend.md)]

WaaSUpdateStatus records contain device-centric data and acts as the device record for Update Compliance. Each record provided in daily snapshots maps to a single device in a single tenant. This table has data such as the current device's installed version of Windows, whether it is on the latest available updates, and whether the device needs attention.

|**Computer** |[string](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string) |`JohnPC-Contoso` |User or Organization-provided device name.

|**FeaturePauseDays** |[int](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/int) |`0` |*Deprecated* This provides the count of days left in a pause |
|**FeaturePauseState** |[int](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/int) |`NotConfigured` |The on-client Windows Update for Business Pause state. Reflects whether or not a device has paused Feature Updates.<br><li> **Expired**: The pause period has expired.<li> **NotConfigured**: Pause is not configured.<li> **Paused**: The device was last reported to be pausing this content type.<li> **NotPaused**: The device was last reported to not have any pause on this content type. |
|**QualityDeferralDays** |[int](/azure/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/int) |`0` |The on-client Windows Update for Business Deferral Policy days.<br><li> **<0**: A value below 0 indicates the policy is disabled. <li> **0**: A value of 0 indicates the policy is enabled, but the deferral period is zero days. <li> **1+**: A value of 1 and above indicates the deferral setting, in days. |
