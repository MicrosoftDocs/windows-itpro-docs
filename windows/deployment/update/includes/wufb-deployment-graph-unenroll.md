When a device no longer needs to be managed by the deployment service, unenroll it. Just like [enrolling a device](#enroll-devices), specify either `driver` or `feature` as the value for the `updateCategory`. The device will no longer receive updates from the deployment service for the specified update category. Depending on the device's configuration, it may start to receive updates from Windows Update. For instance, if a device is still enrolled for feature updates, but it's unenrolled from drivers:

- Existing driver deployments from the service won't be offered to the device
- The device will continue to receive feature updates from the deployment service
- Drivers may start being installed from Windows Update depending on the device's configuration

To unenroll a device, POST to [updatableAssets](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-updatableasset) using [unenrollAssets](/graph/api/windowsupdates-updatableasset-unenrollassets). In the request body, specify:
- **Azure AD Device ID** as `id` for the device
- Either `feature` or `driver` for the updateCategory

The following example removes `driver` enrollment for two devices, `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef` and `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcde0`:

```msgraph-interactive
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/windows/updates/updatableAssets/unenrollAssets
content-type: application/json

{
  "updateCategory": "driver",
  "assets": [
    {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.windowsUpdates.azureADDevice",
      "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
    },
    {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.windowsUpdates.azureADDevice",
      "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcde0"
    }
  ]
}
```
