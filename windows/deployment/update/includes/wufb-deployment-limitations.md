Windows Update for Business deployment service is a Windows service hosted in Azure that uses Windows diagnostic data. You should be aware that Windows Update for Business deployment service doesn't meet [US Government community compliance (GCC)](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc#us-government-community-compliance) requirements. For a list of GCC offerings for Microsoft products and services, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home).
