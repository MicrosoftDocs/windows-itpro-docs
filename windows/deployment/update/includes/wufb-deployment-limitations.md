Windows Update for Business deployment service is a Windows service hosted in Azure Commercial that uses Windows diagnostic data. While customers with GCC tenants may choose to use it, the Windows Update for Business deployment service is outside the [US Government community compliance (GCC)](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc#us-government-community-compliance) boundary. For a list of GCC offerings for Microsoft products and services, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home).

Windows Update for Business deployment service isn't available in Azure Government for [Office 365 GCC High and DoD](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod) tenants.
