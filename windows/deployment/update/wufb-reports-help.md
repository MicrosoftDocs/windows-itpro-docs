To share feedback about the current article, select **This page**. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is a prerequisite for providing documentation feedback. Once you sign in, there's a one-time authorization for the MicrosoftDocs organization. It then opens the GitHub new issue form. Add a descriptive title and detailed feedback in the body, but don't modify the document details section. Then select **Submit new issue** to file a new issue for the target article in the [Windows-ITPro-docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues).

To see whether there's already feedback for this article, select **View all page feedback**. This action opens a GitHub issue query for this article. By default it displays both open and closed issues. Review any existing feedback before you submit a new issue. If you find a related issue, select the face icon to add a reaction, add a comment to the thread, or **Subscribe** to receive notifications.

If you create an issue for something not related to documentation, Microsoft will close the issue and redirect you to a better feedback channel. For example:

- [Product feedback](#send-product-feedback) for Windows Update for Business reports
- [Product questions (using Microsoft Q&A)](/answers/products/)
- [Support requests](#open-a-microsoft-support-case) for Windows Update for Business reports
