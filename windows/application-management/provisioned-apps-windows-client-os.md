# Provisioned apps installed with the Windows client OS

**Applies to**:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

Provisioned apps are included with the OS, and automatically installed when a user signs into a Windows device the first time. They're per-user apps, and typically installed in the `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` folder. On your Windows devices, you can use Windows PowerShell to see the provisioned apps automatically installed.

This article lists some of the built-in provisioned apps on the different Windows client OS versions, and lists the Windows PowerShell command to get a list.

## Use Windows PowerShell

To get a list of all the provisioned apps, use Windows PowerShell:

1. Open the Windows PowerShell app as administrator.
2. Run the following script:

    ```Powershell
    Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Format-Table DisplayName, PackageName
    ```

The output lists all the provisioned apps, and their package names. For more information on this command, see [Get-AppxProvisionedPackage](/powershell/module/dism/get-appxprovisionedpackage) (opens another Microsoft website).

## Built-in provisioned apps list

The following information lists some of the provisioned apps on the different Windows Enterprise client OS versions. Your specific OS version and image may have different apps. To confirm your app list, run the [PowerShell Get-AppxProvisionedPackage command](#use-windows-powershell) (in this article).

Provisioned apps are also listed in **Settings** > **Apps and Features**.
