* Application Virtualization (App-V) Package Accelerator

## App-V support for Office 2010

## Creating Office 2010 App-V using the sequencer

Sequencing Office 2010 is one of the main methods for creating an Office 2010 package on App-V. For more information, see [How to Sequence a New Application with App-V 5.0](/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/appv-v5/how-to-sequence-a-new-application-with-app-v-50-beta-gb18030).

## Deploying the Microsoft Office package for App-V

You can deploy Office 2010 packages by using any of the following App-V deployment methods:

* Microsoft Configuration Manager
* App-V server
* Stand-alone through Windows PowerShell commands

## Office App-V package management and customization

Office 2010 packages can be managed like any other App-V packages through known package management mechanisms. No special instructions are needed, for example, to add, publish, unpublish, or remove Office packages.
