# Deploying Microsoft Office 2010 by Using App-V

[!INCLUDE [Applies to Windows client versions](../includes/applies-to-windows-client-versions.md)]

You can create Office 2010 packages for Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) using one of the following methods:

* Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer
* Application Virtualization (App-V) Package Accelerator

## App-V support for Office 2010

The following table shows the App-V versions, methods of Office package creation, supported licensing, and supported deployments for Office 2010.

|Supported item|Support level|
|---|---|
|Package creation|- Sequencing<br>- Package Accelerator<br>- Office Deployment Kit|
|Supported licensing|Volume Licensing|
|Supported deployments|- Desktop<br>- Personal VDI<br>- RDS|

## Creating Office 2010 App-V using the sequencer

Sequencing Office 2010 is one of the main methods for creating an Office 2010 package on App-V. Microsoft has provided a detailed recipe through a Knowledge Base article. For detailed instructions about how to create an Office 2010 package on App-V, see [How To Sequence Microsoft Office 2010 in Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2830069).

## Creating Office 2010 App-V packages using package accelerators

Office 2010 App-V packages can be created through package accelerators. Microsoft has provided package accelerators for creating Office 2010 on Windows 10/11, Windows 8, and Windows 7. The following pages will show you which package accelerator is best for creating Office 2010 App-V packages on your version of Windows:

* [App-V 5.0 Package Accelerator for Office Professional Plus 2010 – Windows 8](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/App-V-50-Package-a29410db)
* [App-V 5.0 Package Accelerator for Office Professional Plus 2010 – Windows 7](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/App-V-50-Package-e7ef536b)

For detailed instructions on how to create virtual application packages using App-V package accelerators, see [How to Create a Virtual Application Package Using an App-V Package Accelerator](appv-create-a-virtual-application-package-package-accelerator.md).

## Deploying the Microsoft Office package for App-V

You can deploy Office 2010 packages by using any of the following App-V deployment methods:

* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
* App-V server
* Stand-alone through Windows PowerShell commands

## Office App-V package management and customization

Office 2010 packages can be managed like any other App-V packages through known package management mechanisms. No special instructions are needed, for example, to add, publish, unpublish, or remove Office packages.

## Microsoft Office integration with Windows

The following table provides a full list of supported integration points for Office 2010.
