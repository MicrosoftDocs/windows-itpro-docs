# App-V for Windows client prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Applies to Windows client versions](../includes/applies-to-windows-client-versions.md)]

Before installing App-V for Windows client, ensure that you have installed all of the following required prerequisite software.

For a list of supported operating systems and hardware requirements for the App-V server, sequencer, and client, see [App-V Supported Configurations](appv-supported-configurations.md).

## Summary of software preinstalled on each operating system

The following table indicates the software that is already installed for different operating systems.

|Operating system|Prerequisite description|
|---|---|
|Windows 10/11|All prerequisite software is already installed.|
|Windows 8.1|All prerequisite software is already installed.<br>If you're running Windows 8, upgrade to Windows 8.1 before using App-V.|
|Windows Server 2016|The following prerequisite software is already installed:<br>- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5<br>- Windows PowerShell 3.0<br><br>Installing Windows PowerShell requires a restart.|
|Windows 7|No prerequisite software is installed. You must install the software before you can install App-V.|

## App-V Server prerequisite software

Install the required prerequisite software for the App-V server components.

### What to know before you start

The account you use to install the App-V Server components must have:

* Administrative rights on the computer on which you are installing the components.
* The ability to query Active Directory Domain Services.

You must specify a port where each component will be hosted, and add the associated firewall rules to allow incoming requests to the specified ports.

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is automatically disabled for the Management Service.

The following are supported deployment scenarios for App-V:

* A stand-alone deployment where all components are deployed on the same server.
* A distributed deployment.

The following deployment scenarios are not supported:

* Installing side-by-side instances of multiple App-V Server versions on the same server.
* Installing the App-V server components on a computer that runs server core or domain controller.

## Sequencer prerequisite software

What to know before installing the prerequisites:

* Best practice: The computer that runs the sequencer should have the same hardware and software configurations as the computers running the virtual applications.

* The sequencing process is resource-intensive, so make sure that the computer running the sequencer has plenty of memory, a fast processor, and a fast hard drive. The system requirements of locally installed applications must not exceed those of the sequencer. For more information, see [App-V supported configurations](appv-supported-configurations.md).
