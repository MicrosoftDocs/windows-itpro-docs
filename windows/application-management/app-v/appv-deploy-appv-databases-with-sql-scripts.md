# How to deploy the App-V databases by using SQL scripts

>Applies to: Windows Server 2016

Use the following instructions to use SQL scripts, rather than the Windows Installer, to:

* Install the App-V databases
* Upgrade the App-V databases to a later version

>[!NOTE]
>If you have already deployed an App-V 5.0 SP3 database or later, the SQL scripts are not required to upgrade to App-V for Windows.

## How to install the App-V databases by using SQL scripts

1. Before you install the database scripts, review and keep a copy of the App-V license terms. By running the database scripts, you are agreeing to the license terms. If you do not accept them, you should not use this software.

2. Copy **appv\_server\_setup.exe** from the App-V release media to a temporary location.

3. From a command prompt, run **appv\_server\_setup.exe** and specify a temporary location for extracting the database scripts.

    ```sql
    appv\_server\_setup.exe /layout c:\\_<temporary location path>_
    ```

4. Browse to the temporary location that you created, open the extracted **DatabaseScripts** folder, and review the appropriate **readme.txt** file for instructions:

    | Database | Location of readme.txt file to use|
    |---|---|
    | Management database | ManagementDatabase subfolder |
    | Reporting database | ReportingDatabase subfolder |

>[!CAUTION]
>The readme.txt file in the ManagementDatabase subfolder is out of date. The information in the updated readme files below is the most current and should supersede the readme information provided in the **DatabaseScripts** folders.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The InsertVersionInfo.sql script is not required for versions of the App-V management database later than App-V 5.0 SP3.

Steps to install "AppVManagement" schema in SQL SERVER.

## PREREQUISITES:

 1. Review the installation package.  The following files MUST exist:

    SQL files
    ---------
    Database.sql
    CreateTables.sql
    CreateStoredProcs.sql
    UpdateTables.sql
    Permissions.sql

 2. Ensure the target SQL Server instance and SQL Server Agent service are running.

 3. If you are not running the scripts directly on the server, ensure the 
    necessary SQL Server client software is installed and available from
    the specified location.  Specifically, the "osql" command must be supported for these scripts to run.

## PREPARATION:

 1. Review the database.sql file and modify as necessary.  Although the
    defaults are likely sufficient, it is suggested that the following
    settings be reviewed:

    DATABASE - ensure name is satisfactory - default is "AppVManagement".   

 2. Review the Permissions.sql file and provide all the necessary account information
    for setting up read and write access on the database. Note: Default settings in the file will not work.

## INSTALLATION:

 1. Run the database.sql against the "master" database.  Your user 
    credential must have the ability to create databases.
    This script will create the database.

 2. Run the following scripts against the "AppVManagement" database using the 
    same account as above in order.

    CreateTables.sql
    CreateStoredProcs.sql
    UpdateTables.sql
    Permissions.sql 

```
