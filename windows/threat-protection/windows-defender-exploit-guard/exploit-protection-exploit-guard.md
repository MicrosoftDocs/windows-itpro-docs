# Protect devices from exploits with Windows Defender Exploit Guard


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1709



**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


**Manageability available with**

- Windows Defender Security Center app
- Group Policy
- PowerShell



Exploit protection automatically applies a number of exploit mitigation techniques on both the operating system processes and on individual apps. 

It is part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md).

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.

Exploit protection works best with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) - which gives you detailed reporting into Windows Defender EG events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

 You [configure these settings using the Windows Defender Security Center app or PowerShell](customize-exploit-protection.md) on an individual machine, and then [export the configuration as an XML file that you can deploy to other machines](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md). You can use Group Policy to distribute the XML file to multiple devices at once.

 When a mitigation is encountered on the machine, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center. You can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your company details and contact information. You can also enable the rules individually to customize what techniques the feature monitors.

  You can also use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how Exploit protection would impact your organization if it were enabled.

 Many of the features in the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751) have been included in Exploit protection, and you can convert and import existing EMET configuration profiles into Exploit protection.

 >[!IMPORTANT]
 >If you are currently using EMET you should be aware that [EMET will reach end of life on July 31, 2018](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2016/11/03/beyond-emet/). You should consider replacing EMET with Exploit protection in Windows 10. You can [convert an existing EMET configuration file into Exploit protection](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md#convert-an-emet-configuration-file-to-an-exploit-protection-configuration-file) to make the migration easier and keep your existing settings.

 

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met before Exploit protection will work:

Windows 10 version | Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
-|-
Insider Preview build 16232 or later (dated July 1, 2017 or later) | For full reporting you need a license for [Windows Defender ATP](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)


 ## Review Exploit protection events in Windows Event Viewer

You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when Exploit protection blocks (or audits) an app:

1. Download the [Exploit Guard Evaluation Package](https://aka.ms/mp7z2w) and extract the file *ep-events.xml* to an easily accessible location on the machine.

2. Type **Event viewer** in the Start menu to open the Windows Event Viewer.

3. On the left panel, under **Actions**, click **Import custom view...**

    ![Antimated GIF highlighting the import custom view button on the right pane ](images/events-import.gif)

4. Navigate to where you extracted *ep-events.xml* and select it. Alternatively, [copy the XML directly](event-views-exploit-guard.md).

5. Click **OK**.

6. This will create a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to Exploit protection:

Provider/source | Event ID | Description
-|:-:|-
Security-Mitigations | 1 | ACG audit
Security-Mitigations | 2 | ACG enforce
