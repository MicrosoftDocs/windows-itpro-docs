# Protect your network with Windows Defender Exploit Guard

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1709



**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


**Manageability available with**

- Group Policy
- PowerShell
- Configuration service providers for mobile device management


Network protection helps reduce the attack surface of your devices from Internet-based events. It prevents employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet. 

It expands the scope of [Windows Defender SmartScreen](../windows-defender-smartscreen/windows-defender-smartscreen-overview.md) to block all outboud HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources (based on the domain or hostname).

It is part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md).

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.


Network protection works best with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) - which gives you detailed reporting into Windows Defender EG events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

When Network protection blocks a connection, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center. You can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your company details and contact information. You can also enable the rules individually to customize what techniques the feature monitors.

You can also use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how Network protection would impact your organization if it were enabled.



## Requirements

The following requirements must be met before Network protection will work:

Windows 10 version | Windows Defender Antivirus
- | -
Insider Preview build 16232 or later (dated July 1, 2017 or later) | [Windows Defender AV real-time protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) and [cloud-delivered protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) must be enabled


## Review Network protection events in Windows Event Viewer


You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when Network protection blocks (or audits) access to a malicious IP or domain:

1. Download the [Exploit Guard Evaluation Package](https://aka.ms/mp7z2w) and extract the file *np-events.xml* to an easily accessible location on the machine.

1. Type **Event viewer** in the Start menu to open the Windows Event Viewer.

2. On the left panel, under **Actions**, click **Import custom view...**

    ![Antimation of the import custom view option](images/events-import.gif)

3. Navigate to the Exploit Guard Evaluation Package, and select the file *np-events.xml*. Alternatively, [copy the XML directly](event-views-exploit-guard.md).

4. Click **OK**.

5. This will create a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to Network protection:

 Event ID | Description
-|-
5007 | Event when settings are changed
1125 | Event when Network protection fires in Audit-mode 
1126 | Event when Network protection fires in Block-mode
