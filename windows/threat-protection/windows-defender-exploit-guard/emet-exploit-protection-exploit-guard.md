# Comparison between Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit and Windows Defender Exploit Guard


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1709



**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


>[!IMPORTANT]
 >If you are currently using EMET you should be aware that [EMET will reach end of life on July 31, 2018](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2016/11/03/beyond-emet/). You should consider replacing EMET with Exploit protection in Windows 10. You can [convert an existing EMET configuration file into Exploit protection](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md#convert-an-emet-configuration-file-to-an-exploit-protection-configuration-file) to make the migration easier and keep your existing settings.


 The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is a stand-alone product that is available on earlier versions of Windows and provides a number of system- and app-based mitigations against known exploit techniques.

 After July 31, 2018, it will reach its end of life, which means it will not be supported and no additional development will be made for it.

 In Windows 10, version 1709 (also known as the Fall Creators Update), we released Windows Defender Exploit Guard, which provides unparalleled mitigation of known and unknown threat attack vectors, including exploits. 
 
 Windows Defender Exploit Guard is our successor to EMET and provides stronger protection, more customization, an easier user interface, and better configuration and management options.

## Mitigation comparison

The mitigations available in EMET are included in Windows Defender Exploit Guard, under the [Exploit protection feature](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md).

The table in this section indicates the availability of mitigations between EMET and Exploit protection.

Mitigation | Description | Available in Windows Defender Exploit Guard | Available in EMET
