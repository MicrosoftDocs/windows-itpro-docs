# Top scoring in industry antivirus tests

[Antivirus capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection ([Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)) **consistently achieve high scores** from independent tests, displaying how Windows Defender ATP is a top choice in the antivirus market.

We want to be transparent and have gathered top industry reports that demonstrate our enterprise antivirus capabilities. Note that these tests only provide results for antivirus and do not test for additional security protections.

In the real world, millions of devices are protected from cyberattacks every day, sometimes [milliseconds after a campaign starts](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/03/07/behavior-monitoring-combined-with-machine-learning-spoils-a-massive-dofoil-coin-mining-campaign/). In many cases, customers might not even know they were protected. That's because Windows Defender ATP's [next generation protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy3MOxkX_o4) detects and stops malware at first sight by using predictive technologies, [machine learning](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/06/07/machine-learning-vs-social-engineering/), [artificial intelligence](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/02/14/how-artificial-intelligence-stopped-an-emotet-outbreak/), behavioral analysis, and other advanced technologies.

## AV-TEST: Perfect protection score of 6.0/6.0 in the latest test

The AV-TEST Product Review and Certification Report tests on three categories: protection, performance, and usability. The scores listed below are for the protection category which has two scores: real world testing and the AV-TEST reference set (known as "prevalent malware").

**Real-World testing** as defined by AV-TEST refers to protection against zero-day malware attacks, inclusive of web and email threats.

**Prevalent malware** as defined by AV-TEST refers to detection of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last four weeks.

Note: Microsoft sees a wider and broader set of threats beyond just what’s tested in the AV-TEST evaluation.

The below scores are the results of AV-TEST's evaluations on **Windows Defender ATP antivirus capabilities**.

|Month (2018)|Real-World test score| Prevalent malware test score | AV-TEST report| Microsoft analysis|

## AV-Comparatives: Perfect protection rating of 100% in the latest test

AV-Comparatives is an independent organization offering systematic testing for security software such as PC/Mac-based antivirus products and mobile security solutions.

The  **Real-World Protection Test (Enterprise)** as defined by AV-Comparatives evaluates the “real-world” protection capabilities with default settings. The goal is to find out whether the security software protects the computer by either hindering the malware from changing any systems or remediating all changes if any were made.

The **Malware Protection Test Enterprise** as defined by AV-Comparatives assesses a security program’s ability to protect a system against infection by malicious files before, during or after execution. It is only tested every *six months*.

Note: Microsoft sees a wider and broader set of threats beyond just what’s tested in the AV-Comparatives evaluation.

The below scores are the results of AV-Comparatives tests on **Windows Defender ATP antivirus capabilities**. The scores are specifically for the ability to block malware.

|Month (2018)| Real-World test score| Malware test score (every 6 months)|
|---|---|---|
|February| 100.00%| N/A|
|March| 94.40%| 99.90%|
|April| 96.40%%| N/A|
|May| 100.00%| N/A|
|June| 99.50%%| N/A|
|July| 100.00%| N/A|

## To what extent are tests representative of protection in the real world?

It is important to remember that the capabilities within [Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) provide [additional layers of protection](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/12/11/detonating-a-bad-rabbit-windows-defender-antivirus-and-layered-machine-learning-defenses/) that are not factored into AV tests. Using these tests, customer can view one aspect of their security suite but can't assess the complete protection of all the security features.

There are other technologies in nearly every endpoint security suite that address some of the latest and most sophisticated threats, but are not represented in AV tests. For example, the capabilities such as attack surface reduction and endpoint detection & response help prevent malware from getting onto devices in the first place.

 Customers need more comprehensive reports that demonstrate end to end protections, but until then customers can evaluate Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection in their own networks by signing up for a [90-day trial of Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) today, or [enabling Preview features on existing tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/preview-settings-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection).
