# Web sign-in for Windows

Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2 with [KB5030310][KB-1], you can enable a web-based sign-in experience on Microsoft Entra joined devices.
This feature is called *Web sign-in*, and it unlocks new sign-in options and capabilities.

Web sign-in is a *credential provider*, and it was initially introduced in Windows 10 with support for Temporary Access Pass (TAP) only. With the release of Windows 11, the supported scenarios and capabilities of Web sign-in are expanded.\
For example, you can sign in with the Microsoft Authenticator app or with a SAML-P federated identity.

This article describes how to configure Web sign-in and the supported key scenarios.

## System requirements

Here are the prerequisites for using Web sign-in:

- Windows 11, version 22H2 with [5030310][KB-1], or later
- [Microsoft Entra joined](/entra/identity/devices/concept-directory-join)
- Internet connectivity, as the authentication is done over the Internet

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Web sign-in is not supported for Microsoft Entra hybrid joined or domain joined devices.

[!INCLUDE [federated-sign-in](../../../../includes/licensing/web-sign-in.md)]

## Configure web sign-in

To use web sign-in, your devices must be configured with different policies. Review the following instructions to configure your devices using either Microsoft Intune or a provisioning package (PPKG).

> [!NOTE]
> Web sign-in uses a system-managed local account called *WsiAccount*. The account is created automatically when you enable Web sign-in, and it's not displayed in the user selection list. Every time a user uses the Web sign-in credential provider, the *WsiAccount* account is enabled. After the user signs in, the account is disabled.

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../../images/icons/intune.svg"::: **Intune**](#tab/intune)

[!INCLUDE [intune-settings-catalog-1](../../../../includes/configure/intune-settings-catalog-1.md)]

| Category | Setting name | Value |
|--|--|--|
| Authentication | Enable Web Sign In | Enabled |
| Authentication | Configure Web Sign In Allowed Urls | This setting is optional, and it contains a list of domains required for sign in, for example:<br>- `idp.example.com`<br>- `example.com` |
| Authentication | Configure Webcam Access Domain Names | This setting is optional, and it should be configured if you need to use the webcam during the sign-in process. Specify the list of domains that are allowed to use the webcam during the sign-in process, for example: `example.com` |

[!INCLUDE [intune-settings-catalog-2](../../../../includes/configure/intune-settings-catalog-2.md)]

Alternatively, you can configure devices using a [custom policy][INT-1] with the following settings:

| OMA-URI | More information |
|-|-|
| `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Authentication/EnableWebSignIn`| [EnableWebSignIn](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-authentication#enablewebsignin) |
| `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Authentication/ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls`|[ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-authentication#configurewebsigninallowedurls)|
| `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Authentication/ConfigureWebCamAccessDomainNames`|[ConfigureWebcamAccessDomainNames](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-authentication#configurewebcamaccessdomainnames)|

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../../images/icons/provisioning-package.svg"::: **PPKG**](#tab/ppkg)

[!INCLUDE [provisioning-package-1](../../../../includes/configure/provisioning-package-1.md)]

| Path | Setting name | Value |
|--|--|--|
| `Policies/Authentication` | `EnableWebSignIn` | Enabled |
| `Policies/Authentication` | `ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls` | This setting is optional, and it contains a semicolon-separated list of domains required for sign in, for example: `idp.example.com;example.com` |
| `Policies/Authentication` | `ConfigureWebCamAccessDomainNames` | This setting is optional, and it should be configured if you need to use the webcam during the sign-in process. Specify the list of domains that are allowed to use the webcam during the sign-in process, separated by a semicolon. For example: `example.com` |

[!INCLUDE [provisioning-package-2](../../../../includes/configure/provisioning-package-2.md)]

## User experiences

Once the devices are configured, a new sign-in experience becomes available, as indicated by the presence of the Web sign-in credential provider :::image type="icon" source="images/web-sign-in-credential-provider.svg" border="false"::: in the Windows lock screen.

:::image type="content" source="images/lock-screen.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Windows lock screen showing the Web sign-in credential provider.":::

Here's a list of key scenarios supported by Web sign-in, and a brief animation showing the user experience. Select the thumbnail to start the animation.

### Passwordless sign-in

:::row:::
  :::column span="2":::
  Users can sign in to Windows passwordless, even before enrolling in Windows Hello for Business. For example, by using the Microsoft Authenticator app as a sign-in method.
  :::column-end:::

  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!TIP]
> When used in conjuction with *Windows Hello for Business passwordless*, you can hide the password credential provider from the lock screen as well as in-session authentication scenarios. This enables a truly passwordless Windows experience.

### Windows Hello for Business PIN reset

:::row:::
  :::column span="2":::
  The Windows Hello PIN reset flow is seamless and more robust than in previous versions.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column span="2":::
  > [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=310f7665-6276-4ad8-b76e-429073c10972]
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

For more information, see [PIN reset](../hello-for-business/hello-feature-pin-reset.md).

### Temporary Access Pass (TAP)

:::row:::
  :::column span="2":::
  A Temporary Access Pass (TAP) is a time-limited passcode granted by an administrator to a user. Users can sign in with a TAP using the Web sign-in credential provider. For example:

  - to onboard Windows Hello for Business or a FIDO2 security key
  - if lost or forgotten FIDO2 security key and unknown password

  :::column-end:::
  :::column span="2":::
  > [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=8d80bef4-96a8-4467-8e67-e0637bdabcd8]
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

For more information, see [Use a Temporary Access Pass][AAD-3].

### Federated authentication

:::row:::
  :::column span="2":::
  If the Microsoft Entra tenant is federated with a non-Microsoft SAML-P identity provider (IdP), federated users can sign using the Web sign-in credential provider.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column span="2":::
  > [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=88ad0efb-9031-428c-a3cf-612c47810ecf]
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!TIP]
> To improve the user experience for federated identities:
>
> - Enable Windows Hello for Business. Once the user signs in, the user can enroll in Windows Hello for Business and then use it to sign in to the device
> - Configure the *preferred Microsoft Entra tenant name* feature, which allows users to select the domain name during the sign-in process. The users are then automatically redirected to the identity provider sign-in page
>    :::image type="content" source="images/web-sign-in-preferred-tenant.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Windows lock screen with preferred tenant configured.":::

For more information about preferred tenant name, see [Authentication CSP - PreferredAadTenantDomainName][WIN-1].

## Important considerations

Here's a list of important considerations to keep in mind when configuring or using Web sign-in:

- Cached credentials aren't supported with Web sign-in. If the device is offline, the user can't use the Web sign-in credential provider to sign in
- After sign out, the user isn't displayed in the user selection list
- Once enabled, the Web sign-in credential provider is the default credential provider for new users signing in to the device. To change the default credential provider, you can use the [DefaultCredentialProvider][WIN-2] ADMX-backed policy
- The user can exit the Web sign-in flow by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> to get back to the Windows lock screen

### Known issues

- If you attempt to sign in while the device is offline, you get the following message: *It doesn't look like you're connected to the Internet. Check your connection and try again*. Selecting the *Back to sign-in* option doesn't bring you back to the lock screen. As a workaround, you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> to get back to the lock screen.
