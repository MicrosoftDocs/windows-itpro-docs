# Smart Card Events

This topic for the IT professional and smart card developer describes events that are related to smart card deployment and development.

A number of events can be used to monitor smart card activities on a computer, including installation, use, and errors. The following sections describe the events and information that can be used to manage smart cards in an organization.

- [Smart card reader name](#smart-card-reader-name)
- [Smart card warning events](#smart-card-warning-events)
- [Smart card error events](#smart-card-error-events)
- [Smart card Plug and Play events](#smart-card-plug-and-play-events)
## Smart card reader name

The Smart Card resource manager doesn't use the device name from Device Manager to describe a smart card reader. Instead, the name is constructed from three device attributes that are queried directly from the smart card reader driver.

The following three attributes are used to construct the smart card reader name:

- Vendor name
- Interface device type
- Device unit

The smart card reader device name is constructed in the form &lt;*VendorName*&gt; &lt;*Type*&gt; &lt;*DeviceUnit*&gt;. For example 'Contoso Smart Card Reader 0' is constructed from the following information:

- Vendor name: Contoso
- Interface device type: Smart Card Reader
- Device unit: 0

## Smart card warning events

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;IOCTL in the following table refers to input and output control.

| **Event ID** | **Warning Message**                 | **Description**                  |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 620          | Smart Card Resource Manager was unable to cancel IOCTL %3 for reader '%2': %1. The reader may no longer be responding. If this error persists, your smart card or reader may not be functioning correctly. %n%nCommand Header: %4 | This occurs if the resource manager attempts to cancel a command to the smart card reader when the smart card service is shutting down or after a smart card is removed from the smart card reader and the command could not be canceled. This can leave the smart card reader in an unusable state until it's removed from the computer or the computer is restarted.<br><br>%1 = Windows error code<br>%2 = Smart card reader name<br>%3 = IOCTL being canceled<br>%4 = First 4 bytes of the command that was sent to the smart card |
| 619          | Smart Card Reader '%2' hasn't responded to IOCTL %3 in %1 seconds. If this error persists, your smart card or reader may not be functioning correctly. %n%nCommand Header: %4              | This occurs when a reader hasn't responded to an IOCTL after an unusually long period of time. Currently, this error is sent after a reader doesn't respond for 150 seconds. This can leave the smart card reader in an unusable state until it's removed from the computer or the computer is restarted.<br><br>%1 = Number of seconds the IOCTL has been waiting<br>%2 = Smart card reader name<br>%3 = IOCTL sent<br>%4 = First 4 bytes of the command that was sent to the smart card         |
