# Windows Defender Credential Guard requirements

For Windows Defender Credential Guard to provide protection, the computers you are protecting must meet certain baseline hardware, firmware, and software requirements, which we will refer to as [Hardware and software requirements](#hardware-and-software-requirements). Additionally, Windows Defender Credential Guard blocks specific authentication capabilities, so applications that require such capabilities will break. We will refer to these requirements as [Application requirements](#application-requirements). Beyond these requirements, computers can meet additional hardware and firmware qualifications, and receive additional protections. Those computers will be more hardened against certain threats. For detailed information on baseline protections, plus protections for improved security that are associated with hardware and firmware options available in 2015, 2016, and 2017, refer to the tables in [Security Considerations](#security-considerations).

## Hardware and software requirements

To provide basic protections against OS level attempts to read Credential Manager domain credentials, NTLM and Kerberos derived credentials, Windows Defender Credential Guard uses:

- Support for Virtualization-based security (required)
- Secure boot (required)
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM, preferred - provides binding to hardware) versions 1.2 and 2.0 are supported, either discrete or firmware
- UEFI lock (preferred - prevents attacker from disabling with a simple registry key change)

The Virtualization-based security requires:

- 64-bit CPU
- CPU virtualization extensions plus extended page tables
- Windows hypervisor (does not require Hyper-V Windows Feature to be installed)

### Windows Defender Credential Guard deployment in virtual machines

Credential Guard can protect secrets in a Hyper-V virtual machine, just as it would on a physical machine. When Credential Guard is deployed on a VM, secrets are protected from attacks inside the VM. Credential Guard does not provide additional protection from privileged system attacks originating from the host.

#### Requirements for running Windows Defender Credential Guard in Hyper-V virtual machines

- The Hyper-V host must have an IOMMU, and run at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 version 1607.
- The Hyper-V virtual machine must be Generation 2, have an enabled virtual TPM, and be running at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10.
  - TPM is not a requirement, but we recommend that you implement TPM.

For information about other host platforms, see [Enabling Windows Server 2016 and Hyper-V virtualization based security features on other platforms](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2016/09/29/enabling-windows-server-2016-and-hyper-v-virtualization-based-security-features-on-other-platforms/).

For information about Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard hardware and software requirements, see [Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard requirements](/windows/access-protection/remote-credential-guard#hardware-and-software-requirements).

## Application requirements

When Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, specific authentication capabilities are blocked, so applications that require such capabilities will break. Applications should be tested prior to deployment to ensure compatibility with the reduced functionality.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling Windows Defender Credential Guard on domain controllers is not recommended at this time.
> Windows Defender Credential Guard does not provide any added security to domain controllers, and can cause application compatibility issues on domain controllers.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Defender Credential Guard does not provide protections for the Active Directory database or the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). The credentials protected by Kerberos and NTLM when Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled are also in the Active Directory database (on domain controllers) and the SAM (for local accounts).

Applications will break if they require:

- Kerberos DES encryption support
- Kerberos unconstrained delegation
- Extracting the Kerberos TGT
- NTLMv1

Applications will prompt and expose credentials to risk if they require:

- Digest authentication
- Credential delegation
- MS-CHAPv2

Applications may cause performance issues when they attempt to hook the isolated Windows Defender Credential Guard process.

Services or protocols that rely on Kerberos, such as file shares, remote desktop, or BranchCache, continue to work and are not affected by Windows Defender Credential Guard.

## Security considerations

All computers that meet baseline protections for hardware, firmware, and software can use Windows Defender Credential Guard.
Computers that meet additional qualifications can provide additional protections to further reduce the attack surface.
The following tables describe baseline protections, plus protections for improved security that are associated with hardware and firmware options available in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning with Windows 10, version 1607, Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) must be enabled by default on new shipping computers.
>
> If you are an OEM, see [PC OEM requirements for Windows Defender Credential Guard](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-security-considerations).

### Baseline protections
