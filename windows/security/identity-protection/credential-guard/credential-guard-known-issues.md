# Windows Defender Credential Guard: Known issues 

**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2019

Windows Defender Credential Guard has certain application requirements. Windows Defender Credential Guard blocks specific authentication capabilities. Therefore applications that require such capabilities will not function when it is enabled. For further information, see [Application requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/access-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements#application-requirements). 

The following known issue has been fixed in the [Cumulative Security Update for November 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4051033):

- Scheduled tasks with domain user stored credentials fail to run when Credential Guard is enabled. The task fails and reports Event ID 104 with the following message: <br>
   "Task Scheduler failed to log on '\Test' . <br>
   Failure occurred in 'LogonUserExEx' . <br>
   User Action: Ensure the credentials for the task are correctly specified. <br>
   Additional Data: Error Value: 2147943726. 2147943726 : ERROR\_LOGON\_FAILURE (The user name or password is incorrect)."
- When enabling NTLM audit on the domain controller, an Event ID 8004 with an indecipherable username format is logged. For example:
    > Log Name: Microsoft-Windows-NTLM/Operational  
    Source: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Netlogon  
    Event ID: 8004  
    Task Category: Auditing NTLM  
    Level:         Information  
    Description:  
    Domain Controller Blocked Audit: Audit NTLM authentication to this domain controller.  
    Secure Channel name: \<Secure Channel Name>  
    User name:  @@CyBAAAAUBQYAMHArBwUAMGAoBQZAQGA1BAbAUGAyBgOAQFAhBwcAsGA6AweAgDA2AQQAMEAwAANAgDA1AQLAIEADBQRAADAtAANAYEA1AwQA0CA5AAOAMEAyAQLAYDAxAwQAEDAEBwMAMEAwAgMAMDACBgRA0HA  
    Domain name: NULL

  - This event stems from a scheduled task running under local user context with the [Cumulative Security Update for November 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/november-27-2017-kb4051033-os-build-14393-1914-447b6b88-e75d-0a24-9ab9-5dcda687aaf4) or later and happens when Credential Guard is enabled.
  - The username appears in an unusual format because local accounts aren't protected by Credential Guard. The task also fails to execute.
  - As a workaround, run the scheduled task under a domain user or the computer's SYSTEM account.

The following known issues have been fixed by servicing releases made available in the Cumulative Security Updates for April 2017:

- [KB4015217 Windows Defender Credential Guard generates double bad password count on Active Directory domain-joined Windows 10 machines](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015217/windows-10-update-kb4015217)

     This issue can potentially lead to unexpected account lockouts. See also Microsoft&reg; Knowledge Base articles [KB4015219](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015219/windows-10-update-kb4015219) and [KB4015221](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015221/windows-10-update-kb4015221)


- [KB4033236 Two incorrect logon attempts sent to Active Directory after Windows Defender Credential Guard installed on Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4033236/two-incorrect-logon-attempts-sent-to-active-directory-after-credential?preview)

    This issue can potentially lead to unexpected account lockouts. The issue was fixed in servicing updates for each of the following operating systems:

    - Windows 10 Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016: 
    [KB4015217 (OS Build 14393.1066 and 14393.1083)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015217) 
    - Windows 10 Version 1511: [KB4015219 (OS Build 10586.873)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015219)
    - Windows 10 Version 1507: [KB4015221 (OS Build 10240.17354)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015221)

## Known issues involving third-party applications

The following issue affects the Java GSS API. See the following Oracle bug database article: 

- [JDK-8161921: Windows 10 Windows Defender Credential Guard does not allow sharing of TGT with Java](http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8161921)

When Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled on Windows 10, the Java GSS API will not authenticate. This is expected behavior because Windows Defender Credential Guard blocks specific application authentication capabilities and will not provide the TGT session key to applications regardless of registry key settings. For further information see [Application requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/access-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements#application-requirements).

The following issue affects Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client:

<sup>[1]</sup> Products that connect to Virtualization Based Security (VBS) protected processes can cause Windows Defender Credential Guard-enabled Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 machines to exhibit high CPU usage. For technical and troubleshooting information, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

- [KB4032786 High CPU usage in the LSAISO process on Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4032786)
