# Configure and provision Windows Hello for Business - hybrid certificate trust

[!INCLUDE [hello-hybrid-certificate-trust](./includes/hello-hybrid-cert-trust.md)]

## Policy Configuration

After the prerequisites are met and the PKI and AD FS configurations are validated, Windows Hello for business must be enabled on the Windows devices. Follow the instructions below to configure your devices using either Microsoft Intune or group policy (GPO).

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../../images/icons/group-policy.svg"::: **GPO**](#tab/gpo)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this section applies to hybrid Azure AD joined devices only.

For hybrid Azure AD joined devices, you can use group policies to configure Windows Hello for Business.
It is suggested to create a security group (for example, *Windows Hello for Business Users*) to make it easy to deploy Windows Hello for Business in phases. You assign the **Group Policy** and **Certificate template permissions** to this group to simplify the deployment by adding the users to the group. This provides users with the proper permissions to provision Windows Hello for Business and to enroll in the Windows Hello for Business authentication certificate.

### Enable Windows Hello for Business group policy setting

The *Enable Windows Hello for Business* group policy setting is the configuration needed for Windows to determine if a user should attempt to enroll for Windows Hello for Business. A user will only attempt enrollment if this policy setting is configured to **enabled**.\
You can configure the *Enable Windows Hello for Business* setting for computer or users:

- Deploying this policy setting to computers (or group of computers) results in all users that sign-in that computer to attempt a Windows Hello for Business enrollment
- Deploying this policy setting to a user (or group of users), results in only that user attempting a Windows Hello for Business enrollment

If both user and computer policy settings are deployed, the user policy setting has precedence.

### Use certificate for on-premises authentication group policy setting

The *Use certificate for on-premises authentication* group policy setting determines if the deployment uses the *key-trust* or *certificate trust* authentication model. You must configure this Group Policy setting to configure Windows to enroll for a Windows Hello for Business authentication certificate. If you do not configure this policy setting, Windows considers the deployment to use key-trust authentication.

### Enable automatic enrollment of certificates group policy setting

Windows Hello for Business provisioning performs the initial enrollment of the Windows Hello for Business authentication certificate. This certificate expires based on the duration configured in the Windows Hello for Business *authentication certificate* template.

The process requires no user interaction, provided the user signs-in using Windows Hello for Business. The certificate is renewed in the background before it expires.

### Enable and configure Windows Hello for Business

Sign-in a domain controller or management workstations with *Domain Admin* equivalent credentials.

1. Start the **Group Policy Management Console** (gpmc.msc)
1. Expand the domain and select the **Group Policy Object** node in the navigation pane
1. Right-click **Group Policy object** and select **New**
1. Type *Enable Windows Hello for Business* in the name box and select **OK**
1. In the content pane, right-click the **Enable Windows Hello for Business** group policy object and select **Edit**
1. In the navigation pane, expand **Policies** under **User Configuration**
1. Expand **Administrative Templates > Windows Component**, and select **Windows Hello for Business**
1. In the content pane, open **Use Windows Hello for Business**. Select **Enable > OK**
1. Open **Use certificate for on-premises authentication**. Select **Enable > OK**
1. Expand **Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies**
1. In the details pane, right-click **Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment** and select **Properties**
1. Select **Enabled** from the **Configuration Model** list
1. Select the **Renew expired certificates**, **update pending certificates**, and **remove revoked certificates** check boxes
1. Select the **Update certificates that use certificate templates** check box
1. Select **OK**
1. Close the **Group Policy Management Editor**

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Hello for Business can be configured using different policies. These policies are optional to configure, but it's recommended to enable *Use a hardware security device*.
> 
> For more information about these policies, see [Group Policy settings for Windows Hello for Business](hello-manage-in-organization.md#group-policy-settings-for-windows-hello-for-business).

### Configure security for GPO

The best way to deploy the Windows Hello for Business GPO is to use security group filtering. Only members of the targeted security group will provision Windows Hello for Business, enabling a phased rollout.

1. Start the **Group Policy Management Console** (gpmc.msc)
1. Expand the domain and select the **Group Policy Object** node in the navigation pane
1. Open the **Enable Windows Hello for Business** GPO
1. In the **Security Filtering** section of the content pane, select **Add**.  Type the name of the security group you previously created (for example, *Windows Hello for Business Users*) and select **OK**
1. Select the **Delegation** tab. Select **Authenticated Users > Advanced**
1. In the **Group or User names** list, select **Authenticated Users**.  In the **Permissions for Authenticated Users** list, clear the **Allow** check box for the **Apply Group Policy** permission. Select **OK**

### Deploy the Windows Hello for Business Group Policy object

The application of Group Policy object uses security group filtering. This solution allows linking the GPO to the domain, ensuring the GPO is scoped to all users. The security group filtering ensures that only the members of the *Windows Hello for Business Users* global group receive and apply the GPO, which results in the provisioning of Windows Hello for Business.

1. Start the **Group Policy Management Console** (gpmc.msc)
1. In the navigation pane, expand the domain and right-click the node that has your Active Directory domain name and select **Link an existing GPO**
1. In the **Select GPO** dialog box, select *Enable Windows Hello for Business* or the name of the Windows Hello for Business Group Policy object you previously created and select **OK**

### Add members to the targeted group

Users (or devices) must receive the Windows Hello for Business group policy settings and have the proper permission to provision  Windows Hello for Business. You can provide users with these settings and permissions by adding members to the *Windows Hello for Business Users* group. Users and groups who aren't members of this group won't attempt to enroll for Windows Hello for Business.

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../../images/icons/intune.svg"::: **Intune**](#tab/intune)

## Configure Windows Hello for Business using Microsoft Intune

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this section applies to Azure AD joined devices managed by Intune. Before proceeding, ensure that you completed the steps described in:
> - [Configure single sign-on for Azure AD joined devices](hello-hybrid-aadj-sso.md)
> - [Using Certificates for AADJ On-premises Single-sign On](hello-hybrid-aadj-sso-cert.md)

For Azure AD joined devices enrolled in Intune, you can use Intune policies to manage Windows Hello for Business.

There are different ways to enable and configure Windows Hello for Business in Intune:

- Using a policy applied at the tenant level. The tenant policy:
  - Is only applied at enrollment time, and any changes to its configuration won't apply to devices already enrolled in Intune
  - It applies to *all devices* getting enrolled in Intune. For this reason, the policy is usually disabled and Windows Hello for Business is enabled using a policy targeted to a security group
- A device configuration policy that is applied *after* device enrollment. Any changes to the policy will be applied to the devices during regular policy refresh intervals. Chose from the following policy types:
  - [Settings catalog][MEM-1]
  - [Security baselines][MEM-2]
  - [Custom policy][MEM-3], via the [PassportForWork CSP][MEM-4]
  - [Account protection policy][MEM-5]
  - [Identity protection policy template][MEM-6]

### Verify the tenant-wide policy

To check the Windows Hello for Business policy applied at enrollment time:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Devices** > **Windows** > **Windows Enrollment**
1. Select **Windows Hello for Business**
1. Verify the status of **Configure Windows Hello for Business** and any settings that may be configured

:::image type="content" source="images/whfb-intune-disable.png" alt-text="Disablement of Windows Hello for Business from Microsoft Intune admin center." lightbox="images/whfb-intune-disable.png":::

If the tenant-wide policy is enabled and configured to your needs, you can skip to [Enroll in Windows Hello for Business](#enroll-in-windows-hello-for-business). Otherwise, follow the instructions below to create a policy using an *account protection* policy.

### Enable and configure Windows Hello for Business

To configure Windows Hello for Business using an *account protection* policy:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Endpoint security** > **Account protection**
1. Select **+ Create Policy**
1. For *Platform**, select **Windows 10 and later** and for *Profile* select **Account protection**
1. Select **Create**
1. Specify a **Name** and, optionally, a **Description** > **Next**
1. Under *Block Windows Hello for Business*, select **Disabled** and multiple policies become available
    - These policies are optional to configure, but it's recommended to configure *Enable to use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)* to **Yes**
    - For more information about these policies, see [MDM policy settings for Windows Hello for Business](hello-manage-in-organization.md#mdm-policy-settings-for-windows-hello-for-business)
1. Under *Enable to certificate for on-premises resources*, select **Disabled** and multiple policies become available
1. Select **Next**
1. Optionally, add *scope tags* > **Next**
1. Assign the policy to a security group that contains as members the devices or users that you want to configure > **Next**
1. Review the policy configuration and select **Create**

## Enroll in Windows Hello for Business

The Windows Hello for Business provisioning process begins immediately after the user profile is loaded and before the user receives their desktop. For the provisioning process to begin, all prerequisite checks must pass.

You can determine the status of the prerequisite checks by viewing the **User Device Registration** admin log under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows**.\
This information is also available using the `dsregcmd /status` command from a console. For more information, see [dsregcmd][AZ-4].

### PIN Setup

This is the process that occurs after a user signs in, to enroll in Windows Hello for Business:

1. The user is prompted with a full screen page to use Windows Hello with the organization account. The user selects **OK**
1. The provisioning flow proceeds to the multi-factor authentication portion of the enrollment. Provisioning informs the user that it's actively attempting to contact the user through their configured form of MFA. The provisioning process doesn't proceed until authentication succeeds, fails or times out. A failed or timeout MFA results in an error and asks the user to retry
1. After a successful MFA, the provisioning flow asks the user to create and validate a PIN. This PIN must observe any PIN complexity policies configured on the device
1. The remainder of the provisioning includes Windows Hello for Business requesting an asymmetric key pair for the user, preferably from the TPM (or required if explicitly set through policy). Once the key pair is acquired, Windows communicates with Azure Active Directory to register the public key. When key registration completes, Windows Hello for Business provisioning informs the user they can use their PIN to sign-in. The user may close the provisioning application and see their desktop. While the user has completed provisioning, Azure AD Connect synchronizes the user's key to Active Directory

> The following is the enrollment behavior prior to Windows Server 2016 update [KB4088889 (14393.2155)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4088889).
> 
> The minimum time needed to synchronize the user's public key from Azure Active Directory to the on-premises Active Directory is 30 minutes. The Azure AD Connect scheduler controls the synchronization interval. 
> **This synchronization latency delays the user's ability to authenticate and use on-premises resources until the user's public key has synchronized to Active Directory.** Once synchronized, the user can authenticate and use on-premises resources.
> Read [Azure AD Connect sync: Scheduler](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-scheduler) to view and adjust the **synchronization cycle** for your organization.
>
> [!NOTE]
> Windows Server 2016 update [KB4088889 (14393.2155)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4088889) provides synchronous certificate enrollment during hybrid certificate trust provisioning.  With this update, users no longer need to wait for Azure AD Connect to sync their  public key on-premises.  Users enroll their certificate during provisioning and can use the certificate for sign-in immediately after completing the provisioning. The update needs to be installed on the federation servers.

After a successful key registration, Windows creates a certificate request using the same key pair to request a certificate.  Windows send the certificate request to the AD FS server for certificate enrollment.

The AD FS registration authority verifies the key used in the certificate request matches the key that was previously registered. On a successful match, the AD FS registration authority signs the certificate request using its enrollment agent certificate and sends it to the certificate authority.

> [!NOTE]
> In order for AD FS to verify the key used in the certificate request, it needs to be able to access the ```https://enterpriseregistration.windows.net``` endpoint.

The certificate authority validates the certificate was signed by the registration authority. On successful validation of the signature, it issues a certificate based on the request and returns the certificate to the AD FS registration authority.  The registration authority returns the certificate to Windows where it then installs the certificate in the current user's certificate store.  Once this process completes, the Windows Hello for Business provisioning workflow informs the user that they can use their PIN to sign-in through the Windows Action Center.
