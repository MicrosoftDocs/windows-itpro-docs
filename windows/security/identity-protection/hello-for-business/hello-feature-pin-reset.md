# PIN reset

Windows Hello for Business provides the capability for users to reset forgotten PINs using the *I forgot my PIN* link from the Sign-in options page in *Settings* or from the Windows lock screen. Users are required to authenticate and complete multi-factor authentication to reset their PIN.

There are two forms of PIN reset:

- **Destructive PIN reset**: with this option, the user's existing PIN and underlying credentials, including any keys or certificates added to their Windows Hello container, are deleted from the client and a new login key and PIN are provisioned. Destructive PIN reset is the default option, and doesn't require configuration.
- **Non-destructive PIN reset**: with this option, the user's Windows Hello for Business container and keys are preserved, but the user's PIN that they use to authorize key usage is changed. For non-destructive PIN reset, you must deploy the **Microsoft PIN Reset Service** and configure your clients' policy to enable the **PIN Recovery** feature.
## Using PIN reset

There are two forms of PIN reset called destructive and non-destructive. Destructive PIN reset is the default and doesn't require configuration. During a destructive PIN reset, the user's existing PIN and underlying credentials, including any keys or certificates added to their Windows Hello container, will be deleted from the client and a new logon key and PIN are provisioned. For non-destructive PIN reset, you must deploy the Microsoft PIN reset service and client policy to enable the PIN recovery feature. During a non-destructive PIN reset, the user's Windows Hello for Business container and keys are preserved, but the user's PIN that they use to authorize key usage is changed.

Destructive and non-destructive PIN reset use the same steps for initiating a PIN reset. If users have forgotten their PINs, but have an alternate sign-in method, they can navigate to Sign-in options in *Settings* and initiate a PIN reset from the PIN options. If users don't have an alternate way to sign into their devices, PIN reset can also be initiated from the Windows lock screen in the PIN credential provider.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For hybrid Azure AD-joined devices, users must have corporate network connectivity to domain controllers to complete destructive PIN reset. If AD FS is being used for certificate trust or for on-premises only deployments, users must also have corporate network connectivity to federation services to reset their PIN.

### Reset PIN from Settings

1. Sign-in to Windows 10 using an alternate credential.
1. Open **Settings**, select **Accounts** > **Sign-in options**.
1. Select **PIN (Windows Hello)** > **I forgot my PIN** and follow the instructions.

### Reset PIN above the Lock Screen

For Azure AD-joined devices:

1. If the PIN credential provider isn't selected, expand the **Sign-in options** link, and select the PIN pad icon.
1. Select **I forgot my PIN** from the PIN credential provider.
1. Select an authentication option from the list of presented options. This list will be based on the different authentication methods enabled in your tenant (like Password, PIN, Security key).
1. Follow the instructions provided by the provisioning process.
1. When finished, unlock your desktop using your newly created PIN.

For Hybrid Azure AD-joined devices:

1. If the PIN credential provider isn't selected, expand the **Sign-in options** link, and select the PIN pad icon.
1. Select **I forgot my PIN** from the PIN credential provider.
1. Enter your password and press enter.
1. Follow the instructions provided by the provisioning process.
1. When finished, unlock your desktop using your newly created PIN.

> [!NOTE]
> Key trust on hybrid Azure AD-joined devices does not support destructive PIN reset from above the Lock Screen. This is due to the sync delay between when a user provisions their Windows Hello for Business credential and being able to use it for sign-in. For this deployment model, you must deploy non-destructive PIN reset for above lock PIN reset to work.

You may find that PIN reset from settings only works post login. Also, the lock screen PIN reset function won't work if you have any matching limitation of self-service password reset from the lock screen. For more information, see [Enable Azure Active Directory self-service password reset at the Windows sign-in screen - General ](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-windows#general-limitations).

## Non-Destructive PIN reset

**Requirements:**

- Azure Active Directory
- Windows Enterprise and Pro editions. There's no licensing requirement for this feature.
- Hybrid Windows Hello for Business deployment
- Azure AD registered, Azure AD joined, and Hybrid Azure AD joined


When non-destructive PIN reset is enabled on a client, a 256-bit AES key is generated locally. The key is added to a user's Windows Hello for Business container and keys as the PIN reset protector. This PIN reset protector is encrypted using a public key retrieved from the Microsoft PIN reset service and then stored on the client for later use during PIN reset. After a user initiates a PIN reset, completes authentication and multi-factor authentication to Azure AD, the encrypted PIN reset protector is sent to the Microsoft PIN reset service, decrypted, and returned to the client. The decrypted PIN reset protector is used to change the PIN used to authorize Windows Hello for Business keys and it's then cleared from memory.

Using Group Policy, Microsoft Intune or a compatible MDM solution, you can configure Windows devices to securely use the **Microsoft PIN Reset Service** which enables users to reset their forgotten PIN without requiring re-enrollment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft PIN Reset service only works with **Enterprise Edition** for Windows 10, version 1709 to 1809 and later, and Windows 11. The feature works with **Enterprise Edition** and **Pro** edition with Windows 10, version 1903 and later, Windows 11.
> The Microsoft PIN Reset service is not currently available in Azure Government.

## Configure Web Sign-in Allowed URLs for Third Party Identity Providers on Azure AD Joined Devices

**Applies to:**

- Azure AD joined devices

The [ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-authentication#authentication-configurewebsigninallowedurls) policy allows you to specify a list of domains that can be reached during PIN reset flows on Azure AD-joined devices. If you have a federated environment and authentication is handled using AD FS or a third-party identity provider, then this policy should be set. When set, it ensures that authentication pages from that identity provider can be used during Azure AD joined PIN reset.

### Configure Web Sign-in Allowed URLs using Microsoft Intune

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
1. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**
1. Enter the following properties:
    - **Platform**: Select **Windows 10 and later**
    - **Profile type**: Select **Templates**
    - In the list of templates that is loaded, select **Custom** > **Create**
1. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:
    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended
1. Select **Next**
1. In **Configuration settings**, select **Add** and enter the following settings:
    - Name: **Web Sign In Allowed URLs**
    - Description: **(Optional) List of domains that are allowed during PIN reset flows**
    - OMA-URI: `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Authentication/ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls`
    - Data type: **String**
    - Value: Provide a semicolon delimited list of domains needed for authentication during the PIN reset scenario. An example value would be **signin.contoso.com;portal.contoso.com**
    :::image type="content" alt-text="Custom Configuration for ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls policy." source="images/pinreset/allowlist.png" lightbox="images/pinreset/allowlist-expanded.png":::
1. Select **Save** > **Next**
1. In **Assignments**, select the security groups that will receive the policy
1. Select **Next**
1. In **Applicability Rules**, select **Next**
1. In **Review + create**, review your settings and select **Create**

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure Government, there is a known issue with PIN reset on Azure AD Joined devices failing. When the user attempts to launch PIN reset, the PIN reset UI shows an error page that says, "We can't open that page right now." The ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls policy can be used to work around this issue. If you are experiencing this problem and you are using Azure US Government cloud, set **login.microsoftonline.us** as the value for the ConfigureWebSignInAllowedUrls policy.
