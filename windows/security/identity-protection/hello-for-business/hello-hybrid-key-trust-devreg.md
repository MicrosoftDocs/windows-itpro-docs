# Configure Device Registration for Hybrid Azure AD joined key trust Windows Hello for Business

You're ready to configure device registration for your hybrid environment. Hybrid Windows Hello for Business deployment needs device registration to enable proper device authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> Before proceeding, you should familiarize yourself with device registration concepts such as:
> * Azure AD registered devices
> * Azure AD-joined devices
> * Hybrid Azure AD-joined devices
>
> You can learn about this and more by reading [What is a device identity](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview)

## Configure Hybrid Azure AD join

Begin configuring device registration to support Hybrid Windows Hello for Business by configuring device registration capabilities in Azure AD.

Follow the guidance on the [How to configure hybrid Azure Active Directory-joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-plan) page. In the **Select your scenario based on your identity infrastructure** section, identify your configuration (either **Managed environment** or **Federated environment**) and perform only the steps applicable to your environment.

If the user principal name (UPN) in your on-premises Active Directory is different from the UPN in Azure AD, you also need to complete the following steps:

- Configure Azure AD Connect to sync the user's on-premises UPN to the onPremisesUserPrincipalName attribute in Azure AD.
- Add the domain name of the on-premises UPN as a [verified domain](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-custom-domain) in Azure AD.

You can learn more about this scenario by reading [Review on-premises UPN support for Hybrid Azure Ad join](/azure/active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-plan#review-on-premises-ad-users-upn-support-for-hybrid-azure-ad-join).

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Hello for Business Hybrid key trust is not supported if your users' on-premises domain cannot be added as a verified domain in Azure AD.
