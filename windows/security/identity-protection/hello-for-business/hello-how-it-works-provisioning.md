# Windows Hello for Business Provisioning

Windows Hello for Business provisioning enables a user to enroll a new, strong, two-factor credential that they can use for passwordless authentication.  Provisioning experience vary based on:

- How the device is joined to Azure Active Directory
- The Windows Hello for Business deployment type
- If the environment is managed or federated

List of provisioning flows:

| Phase  | Description  |
| :----: | :----------- |
| A|The provisioning application hosted in the Cloud Experience Host (CXH) starts provisioning by requesting an access token for the Azure Device Registration Service (ADRS). The application makes the request using the Azure Active Directory Web Account Manager plug-in.<br>Users must provide two factors of authentication.  In this phase, the user has already provided one factor of authentication, typically user name and password. The Azure MFA service provides the second factor of authentication.  If the user has performed Azure MFA within the last 10 minutes, such as when registering the device from the out-of-box-experience (OOBE), then they are not prompted for MFA because the current MFA remains valid.<br>Azure Active Directory validates the access token request and the MFA claim associated with it, creates an ADRS access token, and returns it to the application. |
|B | After receiving an ADRS access token, the application detects if the device has a Windows Hello biometric compatible sensor. If the application detects a biometric sensor, it gives the user the choice to enroll biometrics. After completing or skipping biometric enrollment, the application requires the user to create a PIN and the default (and fall-back gesture when used with biometrics). The user provides and confirms their PIN.  Next, the application requests a Windows Hello for Business key pair from the key pre-generation pool, which includes attestation data.  This is the user key (ukpub/ukpriv).|
|C | The application sends the ADRS token, ukpub, attestation data, and device information to ADRS for user key registration. Azure DRS validates the MFA claim remains current. On successful validation, Azure DRS locates the user's object in Azure Active Directory, writes the key information to a multi-values attribute. The key information includes a reference to the device from which it was created. Azure Active Directory returns a key ID to the application which signals the end of user provisioning and the application exits.|

After completing or skipping biometric enrollment, the application requires the user to create a PIN and the default (and fall-back gesture when used with biometrics).  The user provides and confirms their PIN.  Next, the application requests a Windows Hello for Business key pair from the key pre-generation pool, which includes attestation data.  This is the user key (ukpub/ukpriv).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   C   | The application sends the ADRS token, ukpub, attestation data, and device information to ADRS for user key registration.  Azure DRS validates the MFA claim remains current.  On successful validation, Azure DRS locates the user's object in Azure Active Directory, writes the key information to a multi-values attribute. The key information includes a reference to the device from which it was created. Azure Active Directory returns a key ID and a key receipt to the application, which represents the end of user key registration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Synchronous certificate enrollment does not depend on Azure AD Connect to synchronize the user's public key to issue the Windows Hello for Business authentication certificate.  Users can sign-in using the certificate immediately after provisioning completes.  Azure AD Connect continues to synchronize the public key to Active Directory, but is not shown in this flow.

The application makes the request using the Azure Active Directory Web Account Manager plug-in.<br>  In an on-premises deployment, the plug-in sends the token request to the on-premises STS, such as Active Directory Federation Services.  The on-premises STS authenticates the user and determines if the user should perform another factor of authentication.<br>Users must provide two factors of authentication.
