# Configure Hybrid Azure AD joined Windows Hello for Business: Directory Synchronization

## Directory Synchronization

In hybrid deployments, users register the public portion of their Windows Hello for Business credential with Azure.  Azure AD Connect synchronizes the Windows Hello for Business public key to Active Directory.  

### Group Memberships for the Azure AD Connect Service Account
>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you already have a Windows Server 2016 domain controller in your domain, you can skip **Configure Permissions for Key Synchronization**. For more detail see [Configure Hybrid Windows Hello for Business: Directory Synchronization](./hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-dir-sync.md).

The KeyAdmins global group provides the Azure AD Connect service with the permissions needed to read and write the public key to Active Directory.  

Sign-in a domain controller or management workstation with _Domain Admin_ equivalent credentials.

1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
2. Click the **Users** container in the navigation pane.
3. Right-click **Key Admins** in the details pane and click **Properties**.
4. Click the **Members** tab and click **Add**
5. In the **Enter the object names to select** text box, type the name of the service account used as an AD DS Connector account and click **OK**.
6. Click **OK** to return to **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Active Directory forest has multiple domains, your ADConnect accounts need to be members of the **Enterprise Key Admins** group. This membership is needed to write the keys to other domain users.
