### Require lowercase letters

Use this policy setting to configure the use of lowercase letters in the PIN:

- If you enable this policy setting, Windows requires the user to include at least one lowercase letter in their PIN
- If you disable this policy setting, Windows doesn't allow the user to include lowercase letters in their PIN
- If you don't configure this policy setting, Windows allows, but doesn't require, lowercase letters in the PIN
