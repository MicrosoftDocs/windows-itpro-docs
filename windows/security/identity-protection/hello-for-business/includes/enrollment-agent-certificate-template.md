### Configure an enrollment agent certificate template

A certificate registration authority (CRA) is a trusted authority that validates certificate request. Once it validates the request, it presents the request to the certification authority (CA) for issuance. The CA issues the certificate, returns it to the CRA, which returns the certificate to the requesting user. Windows Hello for Business certificate trust deployments use AD FS as the CRA.

The CRA enrolls for an *enrollment agent certificate*. Once the CRA verifies the certificate request, it signs the certificate request using its enrollment agent certificate and sends it to the CA. The Windows Hello for Business Authentication certificate template is configured to only issue certificates to certificate requests that have been signed with an enrollment agent certificate. The CA only issues a certificate for that template if the registration authority signs the certificate request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the procedures below based on the AD FS service account used in your environment.
