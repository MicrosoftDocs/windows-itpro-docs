### Require digits

Use this policy setting to configure the use of digits in the PIN:

- If you enable this policy setting, Windows requires the user to include at least one digit in their PIN
- If you disable this policy setting, Windows doesn't allow the user to include digits in their PINs
- If you don't configure this policy setting, Windows allows, but doesn't require, digits in the PIN
