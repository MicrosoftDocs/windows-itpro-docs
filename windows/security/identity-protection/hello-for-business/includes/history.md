### History

This setting specifies the number of past PINs that can be associated to a user account that can't be reused. This policy enhances security by ensuring that old PINs are not reused continually. The value must be between 0 to 50 PINs. If this policy is set to 0, then storage of previous PINs is not required.

The default value is 0.

> [!NOTE]
> PIN history is not preserved through PIN reset.
