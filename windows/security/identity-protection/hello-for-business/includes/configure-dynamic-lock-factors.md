### Configure dynamic lock factors

Configure a comma separated list of signal rules in the form of xml for each signal type.

- If you enable this policy setting, the signal rules are evaluated to detect user absence and automatically lock the device
- If you disable or don't configure the setting, users can continue to lock with existing options
