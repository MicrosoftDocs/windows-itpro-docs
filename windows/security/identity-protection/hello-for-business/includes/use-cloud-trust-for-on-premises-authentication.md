### Use cloud trust for on-premises authentication

Use this policy setting to configure Windows Hello for Business to use the cloud Kerberos trust model.

- If you enable this policy setting, Windows Hello for Business uses a Kerberos ticket retrieved from authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID for on-premises authentication
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Windows Hello for Business uses a key or certificate (depending on other policy settings) for on-premises authentication

> Cloud Kerberos trust is incompatible with certificate trust. If the certificate trust policy setting is enabled, it takes precedence over this policy setting.
