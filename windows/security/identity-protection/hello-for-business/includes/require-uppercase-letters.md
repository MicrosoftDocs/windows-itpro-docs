### Require uppercase letters

Use this policy setting to configure the use of uppercase letters in the PIN:

- If you enable this policy setting, Windows requires the user to include at least one uppercase letter in their PIN
- If you disable this policy setting, Windows doesn't allow the user to include uppercase letters in their PIN
- If you don't configure this policy setting, Windows allows, but doesn't require, uppercase letters in the PIN
