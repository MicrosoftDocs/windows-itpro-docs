### Require special characters

Scope: Machine

Use this policy setting to configure the use of special characters in the PIN. Special characters include the following set:

``` text
! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
```

- If you enable this policy setting, Windows requires the user to include at least one special character in their PIN
- If you disable this policy setting, Windows doesn't allow the user to include special characters in their PIN
- If you don't configure this policy setting, Windows allows, but doesn't require, special characters in the PIN
