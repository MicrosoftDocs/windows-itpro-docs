### Use biometrics

Windows Hello for Business enables users to use biometric gestures, such as face and fingerprints, as an alternative to the PIN gesture. However users must still configure a PIN to use in case of failures.

- If you enable or don't configure this policy setting, Windows Hello for Business allows the use biometric gestures
- If you disable this policy setting, Windows Hello for Business prevents the use of biometric gestures

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling this policy prevents the user of biometric gestures on the device for all account types.
