## Windows Hello for Business forgotten PIN user experience

If the user can sign-in with a password, they can reset their PIN by clicking the "I forgot my PIN" link in settings.  Beginning with the Fall Creators Update, users can reset their PIN above the lock screen by clicking the "I forgot my PIN" link on the PIN credential provider.

For on-premises deployments, devices must be well connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs.  Hybrid customers can on-board their Azure tenant to use the Windows Hello for Business PIN reset service to reset their PINs without access to their corporate network.
