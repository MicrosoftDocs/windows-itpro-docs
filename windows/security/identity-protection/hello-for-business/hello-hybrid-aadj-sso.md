# Configure single sign-on for Azure AD joined devices

[!INCLUDE [hello-hybrid-key-trust](./includes/hello-hybrid-keycert-trust-aad.md)]

Windows Hello for Business combined with Azure AD-joined devices makes it easy for users to securely access cloud-based resources using a strong, two-factor credential. Some resources may remain on-premises as enterprises transition resources to the cloud and Azure AD-joined devices may need to access these resources. With additional configurations to the hybrid deployment, you can provide single sign-on to on-premises resources for Azure AD-joined devices using Windows Hello for Business, using a key or a certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps are not needed when using the cloud Kerberos trust model.

## Prerequisites

Unlike hybrid Azure AD-joined devices, Azure AD-joined devices don't have a relationship with your Active Directory domain. This factor changes the way in which users authenticate to Active Directory. Validate the following configurations to ensure they support Azure AD-joined devices:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Distribution Point
> - Domain controller certificates
> - Network infrastructure in place to reach the on-premises domain controllers. If the machines are external, you can use any VPN solution

### CRL Distribution Point (CDP)

Certificates issued by a certificate authority can be revoked. When a certificate authority revokes as certificate, it writes information about the certificate into a *certificate revocation list* (CRL).\
During certificate validation, Windows compares the current certificate with information in the CRL to determine if the certificate is valid.

![Domain Controller Certificate with LDAP CDP.](images/aadj/Certificate-CDP.png)

The preceding domain controller certificate shows a *CRL distribution point* (CDP) in Active Directory. The value in the URL begins with *ldap*. Using Active Directory for domain joined devices provides a highly available CRL distribution point. However, Azure AD joined devices can't read data from Active Directory, and certificate validation doesn't provide an opportunity to authenticate prior to reading the CRL. The authentication becomes a circular problem: the user is attempting to authenticate, but must read Active Directory to complete the authentication, but the user can't read Active Directory because they haven't authenticated.

To resolve this issue, the CRL distribution point must be a location accessible by Azure AD joined devices that doesn't require authentication. The easiest solution is to publish the CRL distribution point on a web server that uses HTTP (not HTTPS).

If your CRL distribution point doesn't list an HTTP distribution point, then you need to reconfigure the issuing certificate authority to include an HTTP CRL distribution point, preferably first, in the list of distribution points.

> [!NOTE]
> If your CA has published both the *Base* and the *Delta CRL*, make sure to publish the *Delta CRL* in the HTTP path. Include web server to fetch the *Delta CRL* by allowing **double escaping** in the (IIS) web server.

### Domain controller certificates

Certificate authorities write CDP information in certificates as they're issued. If the distribution point changes, then previously issued certificates must be reissued for the certificate authority to include the new CDP. The domain controller certificate is one the critical components of Azure AD-joined devices authenticating to Active Directory.

#### Why does Windows need to validate the domain controller certificate?

Windows Hello for Business enforces the strict KDC validation security feature when authenticating from an Azure AD joined device to a domain. This enforcement imposes more restrictive criteria that must be met by the Key Distribution Center (KDC). When authenticating using Windows Hello for Business on an Azure AD joined device, the Windows client validates the reply from the domain controller by ensuring all of the following are met:

- The domain controller has the private key for the certificate provided
- The root CA that issued the domain controller's certificate is in the device's *Trusted Root Certificate Authorities*
- Use the *Kerberos Authentication certificate template* instead of any other older template
- The domain controller's certificate has the *KDC Authentication* extended key usage (EKU)
- The domain controller's certificate's subject alternate name has a DNS Name that matches the name of the domain
- The domain controller's certificate's signature hash algorithm is **sha256**
- The domain controller's certificate's public key is **RSA (2048 Bits)**

Authenticating from a Hybrid Azure AD joined device to a domain using Windows Hello for Business doesn't enforce that the domain controller certificate includes the *KDC Authentication* EKU. If you're adding Azure AD-joined devices to an existing domain environment, make sure to verify that your domain controller certificate has been updated to include the *KDC Authentication* EKU.

## Configure a CRL distribution point for an issuing CA

Use this set of procedures to update the CA that issues domain controller certificates to include an http-based CRL distribution point.

### Configure Internet Information Services to host CRL distribution point

You need to host your new certificate revocation list on a web server so Azure AD-joined devices can easily validate certificates without authentication. You can host these files on web servers many ways. The following steps are just one and may be useful for admins unfamiliar with adding a new CRL distribution point.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not configure the IIS server hosting your CRL distribution point to use https or a server authentication certificate. Clients should access the distribution point using http. 

### Install the web server

1. Sign-in to your server as a local administrator and start **Server Manager** if it didn't start during your sign in
1. Select the **Local Server** node in the navigation pane. Select **Manage** and select **Add Roles and Features**
1. In the **Add Role and Features Wizard**, select **Server Selection**. Verify the selected server is the local server. Select **Server Roles**. Select the check box next to **Web Server (IIS)**
1. Select **Next** through the remaining options in the wizard, accepting the defaults, and install the Web Server role

### Configure the web server

1. Select **Apply** save your selections. Select **Yes** when ask to restart the service. Select **OK** to close the properties dialog box

#### Publish a new CRL

1. On the issuing certificate authority, sign-in as a local administrator. Start the **Certificate Authority** console from **Administrative Tools**
1. In the navigation pane, right-click **Revoked Certificates**, hover over **All Tasks**, and select **Publish**
    ![Publish a New CRL.](images/aadj/publish-new-crl.png)
1. In the **Publish CRL** dialog box, select **New CRL** and select **OK**

#### Validate CDP Publishing

Validate the new CRL distribution point is working.

1. Open a web browser. Navigate to `http://crl.[yourdomain].com/cdp`. You should see two files created from publishing the new CRL
    ![Validate the new CRL.](images/aadj/validate-cdp-using-browser.png)

#### Reissue domain controller certificates

With the CA properly configured with a valid HTTP-based CRL distribution point, you need to reissue certificates to domain controllers as the old certificate doesn't have the updated CRL distribution point. 

1. Sign-in a domain controller using administrative credentials
1. Open the **Run** dialog box. Type **certlm.msc** to open the **Certificate Manager** for the local computer
1. In the navigation pane, expand **Personal**. Select **Certificates**. In the details pane, select the existing domain controller certificate that includes **KDC Authentication** in the list of **Intended Purposes**
    ![Certificate Manager Personal store.](images/aadj/certlm-personal-store.png)
1. Right-click the selected certificate. Hover over **All Tasks** and then select **Renew Certificate with New Key...**. In the **Certificate Enrollment** wizard, select **Next**
    ![Renew with New key.](images/aadj/certlm-renew-with-new-key.png)
1. In the **Request Certificates** page of the wizard, verify the selected certificate has the correct certificate template and ensure the status is available. Select **Enroll**
1. After the enrollment completes, select **Finish** to close the wizard
1. Repeat this procedure on all your domain controllers

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure domain controllers to automatically enroll and renew their certificates. Automatic certificate enrollment helps prevent authentication outages due to expired certificates. Refer to the [Windows Hello Deployment Guides](./hello-deployment-guide.md) to learn how to deploy automatic certificate enrollment for domain controllers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are not using automatic certificate enrollment, create a calendar reminder to alert you two months before the certificate expiration date. Send the reminder to multiple people in the organization to ensure more than one or two people know when these certificates expire.

#### Validate CDP in the new certificate

1. Sign-in a domain controller using administrative credentials
1. Open the **Run** dialog box. Type **certlm.msc** to open the **Certificate Manager** for the local computer
1. In the navigation pane, expand **Personal**. Select **Certificates**. In the details pane, double-click the existing domain controller certificate includes **KDC Authentication** in the list of **Intended Purposes**
1. Select the **Details** tab. Scroll down the list until **CRL Distribution Points** is visible in the **Field** column of the list. Select **CRL Distribution Point**
1. Review the information below the list of fields to confirm the new URL for the CRL distribution point is present in the certificate. Select **OK**
    ![New Certificate with updated CDP.](images/aadj/dc-cert-with-new-cdp.png)

## Deploy the root CA certificate to Azure AD-joined devices

The domain controllers have a certificate that includes the new CRL distribution point. Next, you need the enterprise root certificate so you can deploy it to Azure AD-joined devices. When you deploy the enterprise root certificates to a device, it ensures the device trusts any certificates issued by the certificate authority. Without the certificate, Azure AD-joined devices don't trust domain controller certificates and authentication fails.

### Export the enterprise root certificate

1. Sign-in a domain controller using administrative credentials
1. Open the **Run** dialog box. Type **certlm.msc** to open the **Certificate Manager** for the local computer
1. In the navigation pane, expand **Personal**. Select **Certificates**. In the details pane, double-click the existing domain controller certificate includes **KDC Authentication** in the list of **Intended Purposes**
1. Select the **Certification Path** tab. In the **Certification path** view, select the topmost node and select **View Certificate**
    ![Certificate Path.](images/aadj/certlm-cert-path-tab.png)
1. In the new **Certificate** dialog box, select the **Details** tab. Select **Copy to File**
    ![Details tab and copy to file.](images/aadj/certlm-root-cert-details-tab.png)
1. In the **Certificate Export Wizard**, select **Next**
1. On the **Export File Format** page of the wizard, select **Next**
1. On the **File to Export** page in the wizard, type the name and location of the root certificate and select **Next**. Select **Finish** and then select **OK** to close the success dialog box
    ![Export root certificate.](images/aadj/certlm-export-root-certificate.png)
1. Select **OK**  two times to return to the **Certificate Manager** for the local computer. Close the **Certificate Manager**

### Deploy the certificate via Intune

To configure devices with Microsoft Intune, use a custom policy:

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431" target="_blank"><b>Microsoft Intune admin center</b></a>
1. Select **Devices > Configuration profiles > Create profile**
1. Select **Platform > Windows 8.1 and later** and **Profile type > Trusted certificate**
1. Select **Create**
1. In **Configuration settings**, select the folder icon and browse for the enterprise root certificate file. Once the file is selected, select **Open** to upload it to Intune
1. Under **Destination store** dropdown, select **Computer certificate store - Root**
1. Select **Next**
1. Under **Assignment**, select a security group that contains as members the devices or users that you want to configure > **Next**
1. Review the policy configuration and select **Create**

If you plan on using certificates for on-premises single-sign on, perform the additional steps in [Using Certificates for On-premises Single-sign On](hello-hybrid-aadj-sso-cert.md). Otherwise, you can sign in to an Azure AD joined device with Windows Hello for Business and test SSO to an on-premises resource.
