# Conditional access

**Requirements:**

* Azure Active Directory
* Hybrid Windows Hello for Business deployment

In a mobile-first, cloud-first world, Azure Active Directory enables single sign-on to devices, applications, and services from anywhere. With the proliferation of devices (including BYOD), work off corporate networks, and 3rd party SaaS applications, IT professionals are faced with two opposing goals:

* Empower the end users to be productive wherever and whenever
* Protect the corporate assets at any time

To improve productivity, Azure Active Directory provides your users with a broad range of options to access your corporate assets. With application access management, Azure Active Directory enables you to ensure that only the right people can access your applications. What if you want to have more control over how the right people are accessing your resources under certain conditions? What if you even have conditions under which you want to block access to certain applications even for the right people? For example, it might be OK for you if the right people are accessing certain applications from a trusted network; however, you might not want them to access these applications from a network you don't trust. You can address these questions using conditional access.
