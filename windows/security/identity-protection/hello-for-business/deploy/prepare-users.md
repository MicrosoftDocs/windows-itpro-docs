# Prepare users to provision and use Windows Hello for Business

This article provides guidance on how to prepare users to enroll and to use Windows Hello for Business. It also provides guidance on how to communicate the benefits of Windows Hello for Business to users.

## Multi-factor authentication

The provisioning of Windows Hello requires users to authenticate with multi-factor (MFA). Ensure that you have a solution in place for users to use MFA during the process.

> [!TIP]
> To facilitate user communication and to ensure a successful Windows Hello for Business deployment, you can find customizable material (email templates, posters, trainings, etc.) at [Microsoft Entra templates](https://aka.ms/adminmails).

## Biometric gestures

Depending on the hardware, users might be prompted to register their fingerprint or face. Explain to users that for convenience, they should register their biometric gesture during the provisioning process. The biometric gesture can be used to unlock the device and to authenticate to resources that require Windows Hello for Business. Biometric gestures are valid only on the enrolled device and are not stored outside the device.

## User experience

The next video shows the Windows Hello for Business enrollment experience after a user signs in with a password:

1. Since the device supports biometric authentication, the user is prompted to set up a biometric gesture. This gesture can be used to unlock the device and authenticate to resources that require Windows Hello for Business. The user can skip this step if they don't want to set up a biometric gesture
1. The user is prompted to use Windows Hello with the organization account. The user selects **OK**
1. The provisioning flow proceeds to the multi-factor authentication portion of the enrollment. Provisioning informs the user that it's actively attempting to contact the user through their configured form of MFA. The provisioning process doesn't proceed until authentication succeeds, fails or times out. A failed or timeout MFA results in an error and asks the user to retry
1. After a successful MFA, the provisioning flow asks the user to create and validate a PIN. This PIN must observe any PIN complexity policies configured on the device

After enrollment in Windows Hello, users should use their gesture (such as a PIN or fingerprint) for access to their devices and corporate resources. The unlock gesture is valid only on the enrolled device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although the organization might require users to change their Active Directory or Microsoft Entra account password at regular intervals, changes to their passwords have no effect on Hello.

The next video shows the Windows Hello for Business enrollment experience as part of the out-of-box-experience (OOBE) process:

1. The user joins the device to Microsoft Entra ID and is prompted for MFA during the join process
1. The device is Managed by Microsoft Intune and applies Windows Hello for Business policy settings
1. After the user profile is loaded, but before the access to the desktop is granted, the user must enroll in Windows Hello
