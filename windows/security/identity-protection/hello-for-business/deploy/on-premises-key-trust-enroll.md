# Configure and enroll in Windows Hello for Business in an on-premises key trust model

## Configure Windows Hello for Business policy settings

There's 1 policy setting required to enable Windows Hello for Business in a key trust model:

- [Use Windows Hello for Business](../policy-settings.md#use-windows-hello-for-business)

Another optional, but recommended, policy setting is:

- [Use a hardware security device](../policy-settings.md#use-a-hardware-security-device)

[!INCLUDE [gpo-enable-whfb](includes/gpo-enable-whfb.md)]

[!INCLUDE [gpo-settings-1](../../../../../includes/configure/gpo-settings-1.md)]

| Group policy path | Group policy setting | Value |
| - | - | - |
| **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Hello for Business**<br>or<br> **User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Hello for Business**|Use Windows Hello for Business| **Enabled**|
| **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Hello for Business** |Use a hardware security device| **Enabled**|

[!INCLUDE [gpo-settings-2](../../../../../includes/configure/gpo-settings-2.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The best way to deploy the Windows Hello for Business GPO is to use security group filtering. Only members of the targeted security group will provision Windows Hello for Business, enabling a phased rollout. This solution allows linking the GPO to the domain, ensuring the GPO is scoped to all security principals. The security group filtering ensures that only the members of the global group receive and apply the GPO, which results in the provisioning of Windows Hello for Business.

Additional policy settings can be configured to control the behavior of Windows Hello for Business. For more information, see [Windows Hello for Business policy settings](../policy-settings.md).

## Enroll in Windows Hello for Business

The Windows Hello for Business provisioning process begins immediately after the user profile is loaded and before the user receives their desktop. For the provisioning process to begin, all prerequisite checks must pass.

You can determine the status of the prerequisite checks by viewing the **User Device Registration** admin log under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows**.\
This information is also available using the `dsregcmd.exe /status` command from a console. For more information, see [dsregcmd][AZ-4].
