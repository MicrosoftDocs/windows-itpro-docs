# Manage Windows Hello for Business in your organization

You can create a Group Policy or mobile device management (MDM) policy that will implement Windows Hello on devices running Windows 10.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The Group Policy setting **Turn on PIN sign-in** does not apply to Windows Hello for Business. It still prevents or enables the creation of a convenience PIN for Windows 10, version 1507 and 1511.
>
>Beginning in version 1607, Windows Hello as a convenience PIN is disabled by default on all domain-joined computers. To enable a convenience PIN for Windows 10, version 1607, enable the Group Policy setting **Turn on convenience PIN sign-in**.
>
>Use **PIN Complexity** policy settings to manage PINs for Windows Hello for Business.

## Group Policy settings for Windows Hello for Business

The following table lists the Group Policy settings that you can configure for Windows Hello use in your workplace. These policy settings are available in **User configuration** and **Computer Configuration** under **Policies** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components** &gt; **Windows Hello for Business**.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, the location of the PIN complexity section of the Group Policy is: **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **System** &gt; **PIN Complexity**.

## MDM policy settings for Windows Hello for Business

The following table lists the MDM policy settings that you can configure for Windows Hello for Business use in your workplace. These MDM policy settings use the [PassportForWork configuration service provider (CSP)](/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Starting in Windows 10, version 1607, all devices only have one PIN associated with Windows Hello for Business. This means that any PIN on a device will be subject to the policies specified in the PassportForWork CSP. The values specified take precedence over any complexity rules set via Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or the DeviceLock CSP.

|Policy|Scope|Default|Options|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|UsePassportForWork|Device or user|True|<p>True: Windows Hello for Business will be provisioned for all users on the device.<p>False: Users will not be able to provision Windows Hello for Business. <div class="alert"> **Note:** If Windows Hello for Business is enabled, and then the policy is changed to False, users who previously set up Windows Hello for Business can continue to use it, but will not be able to set up Windows Hello for Business on other devices</div>|
|RequireSecurityDevice|Device or user|False|<p>True: Windows Hello for Business will only be provisioned using TPM.<p>False: Windows Hello for Business will be provisioned using TPM if available, and will be provisioned using software if TPM is not available.|
|ExcludeSecurityDevice<p>TPM12|Device|False|Added in Windows 10, version 1703<p>True: TPM revision 1.2 modules will be disallowed from being used with Windows Hello for Business.<p>False: TPM revision 1.2 modules will be allowed to be used with Windows Hello for Business.|
|EnablePinRecovery|Device or use|False|<p>Added in Windows 10, version 1703<p>True: Windows Hello for Business uses the Azure-based PIN recovery service for PIN reset.<p>False: Windows Hello for Business does not create or store a PIN recovery secret. PIN reset does not use the Azure-based PIN recovery service. For more information about using the PIN recovery service for PIN reset see [Windows Hello for Business PIN Reset](hello-feature-pin-reset.md).|

### Remote

|Policy|Scope|Default|Options|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|UseRemotePassport|Device or user|False|Not currently supported.|

>[!NOTE]
> In Windows 10, version 1709 and later, if policy is not configured to explicitly require letters or special characters, users can optionally set an alphanumeric PIN. Prior to version 1709 the user is required to set a numeric PIN.

## Policy conflicts from multiple policy sources

Windows Hello for Business is designed to be managed by Group Policy or MDM but not a combination of both. If policies are set from both sources it can result in a mixed result of what is actually enforced for a user or device.

Policies for Windows Hello for Business are enforced using the following hierarchy: User Group Policy > Computer Group Policy > User MDM > Device MDM > Device Lock policy. 

Feature enablement policy and certificate trust policy are grouped together and enforced from the same source (either GP or MDM), based on the rule above. The Use Passport for Work policy is used to determine the winning policy source.

All PIN complexity policies are grouped separately from feature enablement and are enforced from a single policy source. Use a hardware security device and RequireSecurityDevice enforcement are also grouped together with PIN complexity policy. Conflict resolution for other Windows Hello for Business policies are enforced on a per policy basis.  

>[!NOTE]
> Windows Hello for Business policy conflict resolution logic does not respect the ControlPolicyConflict/MDMWinsOverGP policy in the Policy CSP.

## How to use Windows Hello for Business with Azure Active Directory

There are three scenarios for using Windows Hello for Business in Azure AD–only organizations:

- **Organizations that use the version of Azure AD included with Office 365**. For these organizations, no additional work is necessary. When Windows 10 was released to general availability, Microsoft changed the behavior of the Office 365 Azure AD stack. When a user selects the option to join a work or school network, the device is automatically joined to the Office 365 tenant's directory partition, a certificate is issued for the device, and it becomes eligible for Office 365 MDM if the tenant has subscribed to that feature. In addition, the user will be prompted to log on and, if MFA is enabled, to enter an MFA proof that Azure AD sends to his or her phone.
- **Organizations that use the free tier of Azure AD**. For these organizations, Microsoft has not enabled automatic domain join to Azure AD. Organizations that have signed up for the free tier have the option to enable or disable this feature, so automatic domain join won't be enabled unless and until the organization's administrators decide to enable it. When that feature is enabled, devices that join the Azure AD domain by using the Connect to work or school dialog box will be automatically registered with Windows Hello for Business support, but previously joined devices will not be registered. 
- **Organizations that have subscribed to Azure AD Premium** have access to the full set of Azure AD MDM features. These features include controls to manage Windows Hello for Business. You can set policies to disable or force the use of Windows Hello for Business, require the use of a TPM, and control the length and strength of PINs set on the device.

If you want to use Windows Hello for Business with certificates, you'll need a device registration system. That means that you set up Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, or a compatible non-Microsoft MDM system and enable it to enroll devices. This is a prerequisite step to use Windows Hello for Business with certificates, no matter the IDP, because the enrollment system is responsible for provisioning the devices with the necessary certificates.
