# Manage Windows Hello for Business in your organization

You can create a Group Policy or mobile device management (MDM) policy to configure Windows Hello for Business on Windows devices.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Windows Hello as a convenience PIN is disabled by default on all domain joined and Azure AD joined devices. To enable a convenience PIN, enable the Group Policy setting **Turn on convenience PIN sign-in**.
>
>Use **PIN Complexity** policy settings to manage PINs for Windows Hello for Business.

## Group Policy settings for Windows Hello for Business

The following table lists the Group Policy settings that you can configure for Windows Hello use in your workplace. These policy settings are available in **User configuration** and **Computer Configuration** under **Policies** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components** &gt; **Windows Hello for Business**.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, the location of the PIN complexity section of the Group Policy is: **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **System** &gt; **PIN Complexity**.

## MDM policy settings for Windows Hello for Business

The following table lists the MDM policy settings that you can configure for Windows Hello for Business use in your workplace. These MDM policy settings use the [PassportForWork configuration service provider (CSP)](/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Starting in Windows 10, version 1607, all devices only have one PIN associated with Windows Hello for Business. This means that any PIN on a device will be subject to the policies specified in the PassportForWork CSP. The values specified take precedence over any complexity rules set via Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or the DeviceLock CSP.

|Policy|Scope|Default|Options|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|UsePassportForWork|Device or user|True|<p>True: Windows Hello for Business will be provisioned for all users on the device.<p>False: Users will not be able to provision Windows Hello for Business. <div class="alert"> **Note:** If Windows Hello for Business is enabled, and then the policy is changed to False, users who previously set up Windows Hello for Business can continue to use it, but will not be able to set up Windows Hello for Business on other devices</div>|
|RequireSecurityDevice|Device or user|False|<p>True: Windows Hello for Business will only be provisioned using TPM.<p>False: Windows Hello for Business will be provisioned using TPM if available, and will be provisioned using software if TPM is not available.|
|ExcludeSecurityDevice<p>TPM12|Device|False|Added in Windows 10, version 1703<p>True: TPM revision 1.2 modules will be disallowed from being used with Windows Hello for Business.<p>False: TPM revision 1.2 modules will be allowed to be used with Windows Hello for Business.|
|EnablePinRecovery|Device or use|False|<p>Added in Windows 10, version 1703<p>True: Windows Hello for Business uses the Azure-based PIN recovery service for PIN reset.<p>False: Windows Hello for Business does not create or store a PIN recovery secret. PIN reset does not use the Azure-based PIN recovery service. For more information about using the PIN recovery service for PIN reset see [Windows Hello for Business PIN Reset](hello-feature-pin-reset.md).|

### Biometrics

|Policy|Scope|Default|Options|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |

|<p>FacialFeaturesUser<p>EnhancedAntiSpoofing|Device|Not configured|<p>Not configured: users can choose whether to turn on enhanced anti-spoofing.<p>True: Enhanced anti-spoofing is required on devices which support it.<p>False: Users cannot turn on enhanced anti-spoofing.|

### PINComplexity

|Policy|Scope|Default|Options|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |

|Maximum PIN length |Device or user|127 |<p>Maximum length that can be set is 127. Maximum length cannot be less than minimum setting.|
|Minimum PIN length|Device or user|6|<p>Minimum length that can be set is 6. Minimum length cannot be greater than maximum setting.|
|Expiration |Device or user|0|<p>Integer value specifies the period of time (in days) that a PIN can be used before the system requires the user to change it. The largest number you can configure for this policy setting is 730. The lowest number you can configure for this policy setting is 0. If this policy is set to 0, then the user's PIN will never expire.|
|History|Device or user|0|<p>Integer value that specifies the number of past PINs that can be associated to a user account that can't be reused. The largest number you can configure for this policy setting is 50. The lowest number you can configure for this policy setting is 0. If this policy is set to 0, then storage of previous PINs is not required.|

### Remote

|Policy|Scope|Default|Options|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|UseRemotePassport|Device or user|False|Not currently supported.|

>[!NOTE]
> In Windows 10, version 1709 and later, if policy is not configured to explicitly require letters or special characters, users can optionally set an alphanumeric PIN. Prior to version 1709 the user is required to set a numeric PIN.

## Policy conflicts from multiple policy sources

Windows Hello for Business is designed to be managed by Group Policy or MDM but not a combination of both. If policies are set from both sources it can result in a mixed result of what is actually enforced for a user or device.

Policies for Windows Hello for Business are enforced using the following hierarchy: User Group Policy > Computer Group Policy > User MDM > Device MDM > Device Lock policy. 

Feature enablement policy and certificate trust policy are grouped together and enforced from the same source (either GP or MDM), based on the rule above. The Use Passport for Work policy is used to determine the winning policy source.

All PIN complexity policies are grouped separately from feature enablement and are enforced from a single policy source. Use a hardware security device and RequireSecurityDevice enforcement are also grouped together with PIN complexity policy. Conflict resolution for other Windows Hello for Business policies are enforced on a per policy basis.  

>[!NOTE]
> Windows Hello for Business policy conflict resolution logic does not respect the ControlPolicyConflict/MDMWinsOverGP policy in the Policy CSP.
