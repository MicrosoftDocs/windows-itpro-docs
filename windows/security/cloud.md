# Windows and cloud security

*This article provides an overview of cloud services built into Windows 11.*

Today’s workforce has more freedom and mobility than ever before. With the growth of enterprise cloud adoption, increased personal app usage, and increased use of third-party apps, the risk of data exposure is at its highest. Enabling Zero-Trust protection, Windows 11 works with Microsoft cloud services to help organizations strengthen their multi-cloud security infrastructure, protect hybrid cloud workloads, and safeguard sensitive information while controlling access and mitigating threats. 

Windows 11 includes the cloud services that are listed in the following table:

| Service type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Access to Azure Active Directory | Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a complete cloud identity and access management solution for managing identities and directories, enabling access to applications, and protecting identities from security threats.<br/>With Azure AD, you can manage and secure identities for your employees, partners, and customers to access the applications and services they need. <br/>Windows 11 works seamlessly with Azure Active Directory to provide secure access, identity management, and single sign-on to apps and services from anywhere. |
| Modern device management (MDM) and Microsoft Endpoint Manager | Remote wipe <br/> Work or school account<br/>Config Lock<br/>Remote device attestation<br/>(other stuff coming soon):Device Installation<br/>DMA Guard<br/>Endpoint Detection and Response<br/>Microsoft Defender Security Center<br/>Smartscreen<br/>System Guard<br/>Windows Hello for Business |
