# BitLocker configuration: known issues

This article describes common issues that affect your BitLocker's configuration and general functionality. This article also provides guidance to address these issues.

## BitLocker encryption is slower in Windows 10 and Windows 11

In both Windows 11, Windows 10, and Windows 7, BitLocker runs in the background to encrypt drives. However, in Windows 11 and Windows 10, BitLocker is less aggressive about requesting resources. This behavior reduces the chance that BitLocker will affect the computer's performance.

To compensate for these changes, BitLocker uses a new conversion model. This model, (referred to as Encrypt-On-Write), makes sure that any new disk writes on all client SKUs and that any internal drives are always encrypted *as soon as you turn on BitLocker*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To preserve backward compatibility, BitLocker uses the previous conversion model to encrypt removable drives.

### Benefits of using the new conversion model

By using the previous conversion model, you cannot consider an internal drive to be protected (and compliant with data protection standards) until the BitLocker conversion is 100 percent complete. Before the process finishes, the data that existed on the drive before encryption began&mdash;that is, potentially compromised data&mdash;can still be read and written without encryption. Therefore, you must wait for the encryption process to finish before you store sensitive data on the drive. Depending on the size of the drive, this delay can be substantial.

By using the new conversion model, you can safely store sensitive data on the drive as soon as you turn on BitLocker. You don't have to wait for the encryption process to finish, and encryption does not adversely affect performance. The tradeoff is that the encryption process for pre-existing data takes more time.

### Other BitLocker enhancements

After Windows 7 was released, several other areas of BitLocker were improved:

- **New encryption algorithm, XTS-AES**. The new algorithm provides additional protection from a class of attacks on encrypted data that rely on manipulating cipher text to cause predictable changes in plain text.

   By default, this algorithm complies with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). FIPS is a United States Government standard that provides a benchmark for implementing cryptographic software.

- **Improved administration features**. You can manage BitLocker on PCs or other devices by using the following interfaces:
   -  BitLocker Wizard
   - manage-bde
   - Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
   - Mobile Device Management (MDM) policy
   - Windows PowerShell
   - Windows Management Interface (WMI)

- **Integration with Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD). BitLocker can store recovery information in Azure AD to make it easier to recover.

- **[Direct memory access (DMA) Port Protection](../kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt.md)**. By using MDM policies to manage BitLocker, you can block a device's DMA ports and secure the device during its startup.

- **[BitLocker Network Unlock](./bitlocker-how-to-enable-network-unlock.md)**. If your BitLocker-enabled desktop or server computer is connected to a wired corporate network in a domain environment, you can automatically unlock its operating system volume during a system restart.

- **Support for [Encrypted Hard Drives](../encrypted-hard-drive.md)**. Encrypted Hard Drives are a new class of hard drives that are self-encrypting at a hardware level and allow for full disk hardware encryption. By taking on that workload, Encrypted Hard Drives increase BitLocker performance and reduce CPU usage and power consumption.

- **Support for classes of HDD/SSD hybrid disks**. BitLocker can encrypt a disk that uses a small SSD as a non-volatile cache in front of the HDD, such as Intel Rapid Storage Technology.

## Hyper-V Gen 2 VM: Cannot access the volume after BitLocker encryption

Consider the following scenario:

1. You turn on BitLocker on a generation-2 virtual machine (VM) that runs on Hyper-V.
1. You add data to the data disk as it encrypts.
1. You restart the VM, and observe the following:
   - The system volume is not encrypted.
   - The encrypted volume is not accessible, and the computer lists the volume's file system as "Unknown."
   - You see a message that resembles: "You need to format the disk in \<*x:*> drive before you can use it"

### Cause

This issue occurs because the third-party filter driver Stcvsm.sys (from StorageCraft) is installed on the VM.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, remove the third-party software.

## Production snapshots fail for virtualized domain controllers that use BitLocker-encrypted disks

You have a Windows Server 2019 or 2016 Hyper-V Server that is hosting VMs (guests) that are configured as Windows domain controllers. BitLocker has encrypted the disks that store the Active Directory database and log files. When you run a “production snapshot” of the domain controller guests, the Volume Snap-Shot (VSS) service does not correctly process the backup.

This issue occurs regardless of any of the following variations in the environment:

- How the domain controller volumes are unlocked.
- Whether the VMs are generation 1 or generation 2.
- Whether the guest operating system is Windows Server 2019, 2016 or 2012 R2.

In the domain controller application log, the VSS event source records event ID 8229:

> ID: 8229  
> Level: Warning  
> ‎Source: VSS  
> Message: A VSS writer has rejected an event with error 0x800423f4. The writer experienced a non-transient error. If the backup process is retried, the error is likely to reoccur.  
>  
> Changes that the writer made to the writer components while handling the event will not be available to the requester.  
>  
> Check the event log for related events from the application hosting the VSS writer.  
>  
> Operation:  
> PostSnapshot Event
>  
> Context:  
> Execution Context: Writer
> Writer Class Id: {b2014c9e-8711-4c5c-a5a9-3cf384484757}  
> Writer Name: NTDS  
> Writer Instance ID: {d170b355-a523-47ba-a5c8-732244f70e75}
> Command Line: C:\\Windows\\system32\\lsass.exe
>  
> Process ID: 680  

In the domain controller Directory Services event log, you see an event that resembles the following:

> Error Microsoft-Windows-ActiveDirectory\_DomainService 1168  
> Internal Processing Internal error: An Active Directory Domain Services error has occurred.
>  
>‎ &nbsp;Additional Data  
> ‎&nbsp;&nbsp;Error value (decimal):  -1022  
>  
> Error value (hex): fffffc02  
>  
> Internal ID: 160207d9  

> [!NOTE]
> The internal ID of this event may differ based on your operating system release and path level.

After this issue occurs, if you run the **VSSADMIN list writers** command, you see output that resembles the following for the Active Directory Domain Services (NTDS) VSS Writer:  

> Writer name: 'NTDS'  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Writer Id: {b2014c9e-8711-4c5c-a5a9-3cf384484757}  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Writer Instance Id: {08321e53-4032-44dc-9b03-7a1a15ad3eb8}  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;State: \[11\] Failed  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Last error: Non-retryable error  

Additionally, you cannot back up the VMs until you restart them.

### Cause

After VSS creates a snapshot of a volume, the VSS writer takes "post snapshot" actions. In the case of a "production snapshot," which you initiate from the host server, Hyper-V tries to mount the snapshotted volume. However, it cannot unlock the volume for unencrypted access. BitLocker on the Hyper-V server does not recognize the volume. Therefore, the access attempt fails and then the snapshot operation fails.

This behavior is by design.

### Workaround

There is one supported way to perform backup and restore of a virtualized domain controller:

- Run Windows Server Backup in the guest operating system.

If you have to take a production snapshot of a virtualized domain controller, you can suspend BitLocker in the guest operating system before you start the production snapshot. However, this approach is not recommended.

For more information and recommendations about backing up virtualized domain controllers, see [Virtualizing Domain Controllers using Hyper-V: Backup and Restore Considerations for Virtualized Domain Controllers](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/virtualized-domain-controllers-hyper-v#backup-and-restore-considerations-for-virtualized-domain-controllers)

### More information

When the VSS NTDS writer requests access to the encrypted drive, the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) generates an error entry that resembles the following:

```console
\# for hex 0xc0210000 / decimal -1071579136
‎ STATUS\_FVE\_LOCKED\_VOLUME ntstatus.h
‎ \# This volume is locked by BitLocker Drive Encryption.
```

The operation produces the following call stack:
