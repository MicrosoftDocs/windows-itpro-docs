# BitLocker recovery guide

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 and above

This article describes how to recover BitLocker keys from AD DS.

Organizations can use BitLocker recovery information saved in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to access BitLocker-protected data. It's recommended to create a recovery model for BitLocker while planning for BitLocker deployment.

This article assumes that it's understood how to set up AD DS to back up BitLocker recovery information automatically, and what types of recovery information are saved to AD DS.

This article doesn't detail how to configure AD DS to store the BitLocker recovery information.

## What is BitLocker recovery?

BitLocker recovery is the process by which access can be restored to a BitLocker-protected drive if the drive can't be unlocked normally. In a recovery scenario, the following options to restore access to the drive are available:

- **The user can supply the recovery password.** If the organization allows users to print or store recovery passwords, the users can enter in the 48-digit recovery password that they printed or stored on a USB drive or with a Microsoft account online. Saving a recovery password with a Microsoft account online is only allowed when BitLocker is used on a PC that isn't a member of a domain.

- **Data recovery agents can use their credentials to unlock the drive.** If the drive is an operating system drive, the drive must be mounted as a data drive on another computer for the data recovery agent to unlock it.

- **A domain administrator can obtain the recovery password from AD DS and use it to unlock the drive.** Storing recovery passwords in AD DS is recommended to provide a way for IT professionals to be able to obtain recovery passwords for drives in an organization if needed. This method makes it mandatory to enable this recovery method in the BitLocker group policy setting **Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered** located at **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **BitLocker Drive Encryption** > **Operating System Drives** in the Local Group Policy Editor. For more information, see [BitLocker Group Policy settings](bitlocker-group-policy-settings.md).

### What causes BitLocker recovery?

The following list provides examples of specific events that will cause BitLocker to enter recovery mode when attempting to start the operating system drive:

- On PCs that use BitLocker Drive Encryption, or on devices such as tablets or phones that use [BitLocker Device Encryption](bitlocker-device-encryption-overview-windows-10.md) only, when an attack is detected, the device will immediately reboot and enter into BitLocker recovery mode. To take advantage of this functionality, administrators can set the **Interactive logon: Machine account lockout threshold** Group Policy setting located in **Computer Configuration** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **Security Options** in the Local Group Policy Editor. Or they can use the **MaxFailedPasswordAttempts** policy of [Exchange ActiveSync](/Exchange/clients/exchange-activesync/exchange-activesync) (also configurable through [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune)), to limit the number of failed password attempts before the device goes into Device Lockout.

- On devices with TPM 1.2, changing the BIOS or firmware boot device order causes BitLocker recovery. However, devices with TPM 2.0 don't start BitLocker recovery in this case. TPM 2.0 doesn't consider a firmware change of boot device order as a security threat because the OS Boot Loader isn't compromised.

- Having the CD or DVD drive before the hard drive in the BIOS boot order and then inserting or removing a CD or DVD.

- Failing to boot from a network drive before booting from the hard drive.

- Docking or undocking a portable computer. In some instances (depending on the computer manufacturer and the BIOS), the docking condition of the portable computer is part of the system measurement and must be consistent to validate the system status and unlock BitLocker. So if a portable computer is connected to its docking station when BitLocker is turned on, then it might also need to be connected to the docking station when it's unlocked. Conversely, if a portable computer isn't connected to its docking station when BitLocker is turned on, then it might need to be disconnected from the docking station when it's unlocked.

- Changes to the NTFS partition table on the disk including creating, deleting, or resizing a primary partition.

- Entering the personal identification number (PIN) incorrectly too many times so that the anti-hammering logic of the TPM is activated. Anti-hammering logic is software or hardware methods that increase the difficulty and cost of a brute force attack on a PIN by not accepting PIN entries until after a certain amount of time has passed.

- Turning off the support for reading the USB device in the pre-boot environment from the BIOS or UEFI firmware if using USB-based keys instead of a TPM.

- Turning off, disabling, deactivating, or clearing the TPM.

- Upgrading critical early startup components, such as a BIOS or UEFI firmware upgrade, causing the related boot measurements to change.

- Forgetting the PIN when PIN authentication has been enabled.

- Updating option ROM firmware.

- Upgrading TPM firmware.

- Adding or removing hardware; for example, inserting a new card in the computer, including some PCMIA wireless cards.

- Removing, inserting, or completely depleting the charge on a smart battery on a portable computer.

- Changes to the master boot record on the disk.

- Changes to the boot manager on the disk.

- Hiding the TPM from the operating system. Some BIOS or UEFI settings can be used to prevent the enumeration of the TPM to the operating system. When implemented, this option can make the TPM hidden from the operating system. When the TPM is hidden, BIOS and UEFI secure startup are disabled, and the TPM doesn't respond to commands from any software.

- Using a different keyboard that doesn't correctly enter the PIN or whose keyboard map doesn't match the keyboard map assumed by the pre-boot environment. This problem can prevent the entry of enhanced PINs.

- Modifying the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) used by the TPM validation profile. For example, including **PCR\[1\]** would result in BitLocker measuring most changes to BIOS settings, causing BitLocker to enter recovery mode even when non-boot critical BIOS settings change.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some computers have BIOS settings that skip measurements to certain PCRs, such as **PCR\[2\]**. Changing this setting in the BIOS would cause BitLocker to enter recovery mode because the PCR measurement will be different.

- Moving the BitLocker-protected drive into a new computer.

- Upgrading the motherboard to a new one with a new TPM.

- Losing the USB flash drive containing the startup key when startup key authentication has been enabled.

- Failing the TPM self-test.

- Having a BIOS, UEFI firmware, or an option ROM component that isn't compliant with the relevant Trusted Computing Group standards for a client computer. For example, a non-compliant implementation may record volatile data (such as time) in the TPM measurements, causing different measurements on each startup and causing BitLocker to start in recovery mode.

- Changing the usage authorization for the storage root key of the TPM to a non-zero value.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The BitLocker TPM initialization process sets the usage authorization value to zero, so another user or process must explicitly have changed this value.

- Disabling the code integrity check or enabling test signing on Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr).

- Pressing the F8 or F10 key during the boot process.

- Adding or removing add-in cards (such as video or network cards), or upgrading firmware on add-in cards.

- Using a BIOS hot key during the boot process to change the boot order to something other than the hard drive.

> [!NOTE]
> Before beginning recovery, it is recommend to determine what caused recovery. This might help prevent the problem from occurring again in the future. For instance, if it is determined that an attacker has modified the computer by obtaining physical access, new security policies can be created for tracking who has physical presence. After the recovery password has been used to recover access to the PC, BitLocker reseals the encryption key to the current values of the measured components.

For planned scenarios, such as a known hardware or firmware upgrades, initiating recovery can be avoided by temporarily suspending BitLocker protection. Because suspending BitLocker leaves the drive fully encrypted, the administrator can quickly resume BitLocker protection after the planned task has been completed. Using suspend and resume also reseals the encryption key without requiring the entry of the recovery key.

> [!NOTE]
> If suspended BitLocker will automatically resume protection when the PC is rebooted, unless a reboot count is specified using the manage-bde command line tool.

If software maintenance requires the computer to be restarted and two-factor authentication is being used, the BitLocker network unlock feature can be enabled to provide the secondary authentication factor when the computers don't have an on-premises user to provide the additional authentication method.

Recovery has been described within the context of unplanned or undesired behavior. However, recovery can also be caused as an intended production scenario, for example in order to manage access control. When desktop or laptop computers are redeployed to other departments or employees in the enterprise, BitLocker can be forced into recovery before the computer is given to a new user.

## Testing recovery

Before a thorough BitLocker recovery process is created, it's recommended to test how the recovery process works for both end users (people who call the helpdesk for the recovery password) and administrators (people who help the end user get the recovery password). The `-forcerecovery` command of `manage-bde.exe` is an easy way to step through the recovery process before users encounter a recovery situation.

**To force a recovery for the local computer:**

1. Select the **Start** button and type in **cmd**

2. Right select on **cmd.exe** or **Command Prompt** and then select **Run as administrator**.

3. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```cmd
    manage-bde.exe -forcerecovery <BitLockerVolume>
    ```

**To force recovery for a remote computer:**

1. Select the **Start** button and type in **cmd**

2. Right select on **cmd.exe** or **Command Prompt** and then select **Run as administrator**.

3. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```cmd
    manage-bde.exe -ComputerName <RemoteComputerName> -forcerecovery <BitLockerVolume>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Recovery triggered by `-forcerecovery` persists for multiple restarts until a TPM protector is added or protection is suspended by the user. When using Modern Standby devices (such as Surface devices), the `-forcerecovery` option is not recommended because BitLocker will have to be unlocked and disabled manually from the WinRE environment before the OS can boot up again. For more information, see [BitLocker Troubleshooting: Continuous reboot loop with BitLocker recovery on a slate device](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/18671.bitlocker-troubleshooting-continuous-reboot-loop-with-bitlocker-recovery-on-a-slate-device.aspx).

## Planning the recovery process

When planning the BitLocker recovery process, first consult the organization's current best practices for recovering sensitive information. For example: How does the enterprise handle lost Windows passwords? How does the organization perform smart card PIN resets? These best practices and related resources (people and tools) can be used to help formulate a BitLocker recovery model.

Organizations that rely on BitLocker Drive Encryption and BitLocker To Go to protect data on a large number of computers and removable drives running the Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7 operating systems and Windows to Go should consider using the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) Tool version 2.0, which is included in the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP) for Microsoft Software Assurance. MBAM makes BitLocker implementations easier to deploy and manage and allows administrators to provision and monitor encryption for operating system and fixed drives. MBAM prompts the user before encrypting fixed drives. MBAM also manages recovery keys for fixed and removable drives, making recovery easier to manage. MBAM can be used as part of a Microsoft System Center deployment or as a stand-alone solution. For more info, see [Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring](/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/mbam-v25/).

After a BitLocker recovery has been initiated, users can use a recovery password to unlock access to encrypted data. Consider both self-recovery and recovery password retrieval methods for the organization.

When the recovery process is determined:

- Become familiar with how a recovery password can be retrieved. See:

  - [Self-recovery](#self-recovery)
  - [Recovery password retrieval](#recovery-password-retrieval)

- Determine a series of steps for post-recovery, including analyzing why the recovery occurred and resetting the recovery password. See:

  - [Post-recovery analysis](#post-recovery-analysis)

### Self-recovery

In some cases, users might have the recovery password in a printout or a USB flash drive and can perform self-recovery. It's recommended that the organization creates a policy for self-recovery. If self-recovery includes using a password or recovery key stored on a USB flash drive, the users must be warned not to store the USB flash drive in the same place as the PC, especially during travel. For example, if both the PC and the recovery items are in the same bag it would be easy for access to be gained to the PC by an unauthorized user. Another policy to consider is having users contact the Helpdesk before or after performing self-recovery so that the root cause can be identified.

### Recovery password retrieval

If the user doesn't have a recovery password printed or on a USB flash drive, the user will need to be able to retrieve the recovery password from an online source. If the PC is a member of a domain, the recovery password can be backed up to AD DS. **However, back up of the recovery password to AD DS does not happen by default.** Backup of the recovery password to AD DS has to be configured via the appropriate group policy settings **before** BitLocker was enabled on the PC. BitLocker group policy settings can be found in the Local Group Policy Editor or the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) under **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **BitLocker Drive Encryption**. The following policy settings define the recovery methods that can be used to restore access to a BitLocker-protected drive if an authentication method fails or is unable to be used.

- **Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered**

- **Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered**

- **Choose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recovered**

In each of these policies, select **Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services** and then choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS. Check the **Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD
DS** check box if it's desired to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information for the drive to AD DS succeeds.

> [!NOTE]
> If the PCs are part of a workgroup, users are advised to save their BitLocker recovery password with their Microsoft account online. Having an online copy of the BitLocker recovery password is recommended to help ensure access to data is not lost in the event of a recovery being required.

The BitLocker Recovery Password Viewer for Active Directory Users and Computers tool allows domain administrators to view BitLocker recovery passwords for specific computer objects in Active Directory.

The following list can be used as a template for creating a recovery process for recovery password retrieval. This sample process uses the BitLocker Recovery Password Viewer for Active Directory Users and Computers tool.

- [Record the name of the user's computer](#record-the-name-of-the-users-computer)
- [Verify the user's identity](#verify-the-users-identity)
- [Locate the recovery password in AD DS](#locate-the-recovery-password-in-ad-ds)
- [Gather information to determine why recovery occurred](#gather-information-to-determine-why-recovery-occurred)
- [Give the user the recovery password](#give-the-user-the-recovery-password)

### Record the name of the user's computer

The name of the user's computer can be used to locate the recovery password in AD DS. If the user doesn't know the name of the computer, ask the user to read the first word of the **Drive Label** in the **BitLocker Drive Encryption Password Entry** user interface. This word is the computer name when BitLocker was enabled and is probably the current name of the computer.

### Verify the user's identity

The person who is asking for the recovery password should be verified as the authorized user of that computer. It should also be verified whether the computer for which the user provided the name belongs to the user.

### Locate the recovery password in AD DS

Locate the computer object with the matching name in AD DS. Because computer object names are listed in the AD DS global catalog, the object should be able to be located even if it's a multi-domain forest.

### Multiple recovery passwords

If multiple recovery passwords are stored under a computer object in AD DS, the name of the BitLocker recovery information object includes the date on which the password was created.

To make sure the correct password is provided and/or to prevent providing the incorrect password, ask the user to read the eight character password ID that is displayed in the recovery console.

Since the password ID is a unique value that is associated with each recovery password stored in AD DS, running a query using this ID finds the correct password to unlock the encrypted volume.

### Gather information to determine why recovery occurred

Before giving the user the recovery password, information should be gatherer that will help determine why the recovery was needed. This information can be used to analyze the root cause during the post-recovery analysis. For more information about post-recovery analysis, see [Post-recovery analysis](#post-recovery-analysis).

### Give the user the recovery password

Because the recovery password is 48 digits long, the user may need to record the password by writing it down or typing it on a different computer. If using MBAM or Configuration Manager BitLocker Management, the recovery password will be regenerated after it's recovered from the MBAM or Configuration Manager database to avoid the security risks associated with an uncontrolled password.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the 48-digit recovery password is long and contains a combination of digits, the user might mishear or mistype the password. The boot-time recovery console uses built-in checksum numbers to detect input errors in each 6-digit block of the 48-digit recovery password, and offers the user the opportunity to correct such errors.

### Post-recovery analysis

When a volume is unlocked using a recovery password, an event is written to the event log, and the platform validation measurements are reset in the TPM to match the current configuration. Unlocking the volume means that the encryption key has been released and is ready for on-the-fly encryption when data is written to the volume, and on-the-fly decryption when data is read from the volume. After the volume is unlocked, BitLocker behaves the same way, regardless of how the access was granted.

If it's noticed that a computer is having repeated recovery password unlocks, an administrator might want to perform post-recovery analysis to determine the root cause of the recovery, and refresh BitLocker platform validation so that the user no longer needs to enter a recovery password each time that the computer starts up. For more information, see:

- [Determine the root cause of the recovery](#determine-the-root-cause-of-the-recovery)
- [Resolve the root cause](#resolve-the-root-cause)

### Determine the root cause of the recovery

If a user needed to recover the drive, it's important to determine the root cause that initiated the recovery as soon as possible. Properly analyzing the state of the computer and detecting tampering may reveal threats that have broader implications for enterprise security.

While an administrator can remotely investigate the cause of recovery in some cases, the end user might need to bring the computer that contains the recovered drive on site to analyze the root cause further.

Review and answer the following questions for the organization:

1. Which BitLocker protection mode is in effect (TPM, TPM + PIN, TPM + startup key, startup key only)? Which PCR profile is in use on the PC?

2. Did the user merely forget the PIN or lose the startup key? If a token was lost, where might the token be?

3. If TPM mode was in effect, was recovery caused by a boot file change?

4. If recovery was caused by a boot file change, is the boot file change due to an intended user action (for example, BIOS upgrade), or a malicious software?

5. When was the user last able to start the computer successfully, and what might have happened to the computer since then?

6. Might the user have encountered malicious software or left the computer unattended since the last successful startup?

To help answer these questions, use the BitLocker command-line tool to view the current configuration and protection mode:

```cmd
manage-bde.exe -status
```

Scan the event log to find events that help indicate why recovery was initiated (for example, if a boot file change occurred). Both of these capabilities can be performed remotely.

### Resolve the root cause

After it has been identified what caused recovery, BitLocker protection can be reset to avoid recovery on every startup.

The details of this reset can vary according to the root cause of the recovery. If root cause can't be determined, or if a malicious software or a rootkit might have infected the computer, Helpdesk should apply best-practice virus policies to react appropriately.

> [!NOTE]
> BitLocker validation profile reset can be performed by suspending and resuming BitLocker.

- [Unknown PIN](#unknown-pin)
- [Lost startup key](#lost-startup-key)
- [Changes to boot files](#changes-to-boot-files)

### Unknown PIN

If a user has forgotten the PIN, the PIN must be reset while signed on to the computer in order to prevent BitLocker from initiating recovery each time the computer is restarted.

#### To prevent continued recovery due to an unknown PIN

1. Unlock the computer using the recovery password.

2. Reset the PIN:

    1. Select and hold the drive and then select **Change PIN**

    2. In the BitLocker Drive Encryption dialog, select **Reset a forgotten PIN**. If the signed in account isn't an administrator account, administrative credentials must be provided at this time.

    3. In the PIN reset dialog, provide and confirm the new PIN to be used and then select **Finish**.

3. The new PIN can be used the next time the drive needs to be unlocked.

### Lost startup key

If the USB flash drive that contains the startup key has been lost, then drive must be unlocked by using the recovery key. A new startup can then be created.

#### To prevent continued recovery due to a lost startup key

1. Sign in as an administrator to the computer that has its startup key lost.

2. Open Manage BitLocker.

3. Select **Duplicate start up key**, insert the clean USB drive where the key will be written, and then select **Save**.

### Changes to boot files

This error occurs if the firmware is updated. As a best practice, BitLocker should be suspended before making changes to the firmware. Protection should then be resumed after the firmware update has completed. Suspending BitLocker prevents the computer from going into recovery mode. However, if changes were made when BitLocker protection was on, the recovery password can be used to unlock the drive and the platform validation profile will be updated so that recovery won't occur the next time.

## Windows RE and BitLocker Device Encryption

Windows Recovery Environment (RE) can be used to recover access to a drive protected by [BitLocker Device Encryption](bitlocker-device-encryption-overview-windows-10.md). If a PC is unable to boot after two failures, Startup Repair automatically starts. When Startup Repair is launched automatically due to boot failures, it executes only operating system and driver file repairs if the boot logs or any available crash dump points to a specific corrupted file. In Windows 8.1 and later versions, devices that include firmware to support specific TPM measurements for PCR\[7\] **the TPM** can validate that Windows RE is a trusted operating environment and unlock any BitLocker-protected drives if Windows RE hasn't been modified. If the Windows RE environment has been modified, for example, the TPM has been disabled, the drives stay locked until the BitLocker recovery key is provided. If Startup Repair isn't able to run automatically from the PC and instead, Windows RE is manually started from a repair disk, the BitLocker recovery key must be provided to unlock the BitLocker-protected drives.

Windows RE will also ask for a BitLocker recovery key when a **Remove everything** reset from Windows RE is started on a device that uses **TPM + PIN** or **Password for OS drive** protectors. If BitLocker recovery is started on a keyboardless device with TPM-only protection, Windows RE, not the boot manager, will ask for the BitLocker recovery key. After the key is entered, Windows RE troubleshooting tools can be accessed, or Windows can be started normally.

The BitLocker recovery screen that's shown by Windows RE has the accessibility tools like narrator and on-screen keyboard to help enter the BitLocker recovery key. If the BitLocker recovery key is requested by the Windows boot manager, those tools might not be available.

To activate the narrator during BitLocker recovery in Windows RE, press **Windows** + **CTRL** + **Enter**. To activate the on-screen keyboard, tap on a text input control.

## BitLocker recovery screen

During BitLocker recovery, Windows displays a custom recovery message and a few hints that identify where a key can be retrieved from. These improvements can help a user during BitLocker recovery.

### Custom recovery message

BitLocker Group Policy settings starting in Windows 10, version 1511, allows configuring a custom recovery message and URL on the BitLocker recovery screen. The custom recovery message and URL can include the address of the BitLocker self-service recovery portal, the IT internal website, or a phone number for support.

This policy can be configured using GPO under **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **BitLocker Drive Encryption** > **Operating System Drives** > **Configure pre-boot recovery message and URL**.

It can also be configured using mobile device management (MDM), including in Intune, using the [BitLocker CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/bitlocker-csp):

**`<LocURI>./Device/Vendor/MSFT/BitLocker/SystemDrivesRecoveryMessage</LocURI>`**

![Custom URL.](./images/bl-intune-custom-url.png)

Example of a customized recovery screen:

![Customized BitLocker Recovery Screen.](./images/bl-password-hint1.png)

### BitLocker recovery key hints

BitLocker metadata has been enhanced starting in Windows 10, version 1903, to include information about when and where the BitLocker recovery key was backed up. This information isn't exposed through the UI or any public API. It's used solely by the BitLocker recovery screen in the form of hints to help a user locate a volume's recovery key. Hints are displayed on the recovery screen and refer to the location where the key has been saved. Hints are displayed on both the modern (blue) and legacy (black) recovery screen. The hints apply to both the boot manager recovery screen and the WinRE unlock screen.

![Customized BitLocker recovery screen.](./images/bl-password-hint2.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is not recommend to print recovery keys or saving them to a file. Instead, use Active Directory backup or a cloud-based backup. Cloud-based backup includes Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft account.

There are rules governing which hint is shown during the recovery (in the order of processing):

1. Always display custom recovery message if it has been configured (using GPO or MDM).

2. Always display generic hint: `For more information, go to https://aka.ms/recoverykeyfaq.`

3. If multiple recovery keys exist on the volume, prioritize the last-created (and successfully backed up) recovery key.

4. Prioritize keys with successful backup over keys that have never been backed up.

5. Prioritize backup hints in the following order for remote backup locations: **Microsoft Account > Azure AD > Active Directory**.

6. If a key has been printed and saved to file, display a combined hint, "Look for a printout or a text file with the key," instead of two separate hints.

7. If multiple backups of the same type (remove vs. local) have been performed for the same recovery key, prioritize backup info with latest backed-up date.

8. There's no specific hint for keys saved to an on-premises Active Directory. In this case, a custom message (if configured) or a generic message, "Contact your organization's help desk," is displayed.

9. If two recovery keys are present on the disk, but only one has been successfully backed up, the system asks for a key that has been backed up, even if another key is newer.

#### Example 1 (single recovery key with single backup)

|     Custom URL       |     Yes    |
|----------------------|------------|

## Using additional recovery information

Besides the 48-digit BitLocker recovery password, other types of recovery information are stored in Active Directory. This section describes how this additional information can be used.

### BitLocker key package

If the recovery methods discussed earlier in this document don't unlock the volume, the BitLocker Repair tool can be used to decrypt the volume at the block level. The tool uses the BitLocker key package to help recover encrypted data from severely damaged drives. The recovered data can then be used to salvage encrypted data, even after the correct recovery password has failed to unlock the damaged volume. It's recommended to still save the recovery password. A key package can't be used without the corresponding recovery password.

> [!NOTE]
> The BitLocker Repair tool `repair-bde.exe` must be used to use the BitLocker key package.

The BitLocker key package isn't saved by default. To save the package along with the recovery password in AD DS, the **Backup recovery password and key package** option must be selected in the group policy settings that control the recovery method. The key package can also be exported from a working volume. For more information on how to export key packages, see [Retrieving the BitLocker Key Package](#retrieving-the-bitlocker-key-package).

## Resetting recovery passwords

It's recommended to invalidate a recovery password after it has been provided and used. The recovery password can be invalidated when it has been provided and used or for any other valid reason.

The recovery password and be invalidated and reset in two ways:

- **Use `manage-bde.exe`**: `manage-bde.exe` can be used to remove the old recovery password and add a new recovery password. The procedure identifies the command and the syntax for this method.

- **Run a script**: A script can be run to reset the password without decrypting the volume. The sample script in the procedure illustrates this functionality. The sample script creates a new recovery password and invalidates all other passwords.

### Resetting a recovery password using `manage-bde.exe`

1. Remove the previous recovery password.

    ```cmd
    `manage-bde.exe` -protectors -delete C: -type RecoveryPassword
    ```

2. Add the new recovery password.

    ```cmd
    `manage-bde.exe` -protectors -add C: -RecoveryPassword
    ```

3. Get the ID of the new recovery password. From the screen, copy the ID of the recovery password.

    ```cmd
    `manage-bde.exe` -protectors -get C: -Type RecoveryPassword
    ```

4. Back up the new recovery password to AD DS.

    ```cmd
    `manage-bde.exe` -protectors -adbackup C: -id {EXAMPLE6-5507-4924-AA9E-AFB2EB003692}
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > The braces `{}` must be included in the ID string.

### Running the sample recovery password script to reset the recovery passwords

1. Save the following sample script in a VBScript file. For example:

    `ResetPassword.vbs`.

2. At the command prompt, enter the following command::

    ```cmd
    cscript.exe ResetPassword.vbs
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This sample script is configured to work only for the C volume. If necessary, customize the script to match the volume where the password reset needs to be tested.

> [!NOTE]
> To manage a remote computer, specify the remote computer name rather than the local computer name.

The following sample VBScript can be used to reset the recovery passwords:

## Retrieving the BitLocker key package

Two methods can be used to retrieve the key package as described in [Using Additional Recovery Information](#using-additional-recovery-information):

- **Export a previously saved key package from AD DS.** Read access is required to BitLocker recovery passwords that are stored in AD DS.

- **Export a new key package from an unlocked, BitLocker-protected volume.** Local administrator access to the working volume is required before any damage occurred to the volume.

### Running the sample key package retrieval script that exports all previously saved key packages from AD DS

The following steps and sample script exports all previously saved key packages from AD DS.

1. Save the following sample script in a VBScript file. For example: `GetBitLockerKeyPackageADDS.vbs`.

2. At the command prompt, enter a command similar to the following sample script:

    ```cmd
    cscript.exe GetBitLockerKeyPackageADDS.vbs -?
    ```
