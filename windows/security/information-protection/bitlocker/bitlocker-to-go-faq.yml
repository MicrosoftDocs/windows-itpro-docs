      - question: What is BitLocker To Go?
        answer: |
          BitLocker To Go is BitLocker Drive Encryption on removable data drives. This feature includes the encryption of: 
          
          - USB flash drives
          - SD cards
          - External hard disk drives
          - Other drives that are formatted by using the NTFS, FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT file system. 
           
          Drive partitioning must meet the [BitLocker Drive Encryption Partitioning Requirements](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/bitlocker-drive-encryption#bitlocker-drive-encryption-partitioning-requirements).
          
          As with BitLocker, you can open drives that are encrypted by BitLocker To Go by using a password or smart card on another computer. In Control Panel, use **BitLocker Drive Encryption**.
