    questions:
      - question: How does BitLocker work?
        answer: |
          **How BitLocker works with operating system drives**
          
          BitLocker Can be used to mitigate unauthorized data access on lost or stolen computers by encrypting all user files and system files on the operating system drive, including the swap files and hibernation files, and checking the integrity of early boot components and boot configuration data.
          
          **How BitLocker works with fixed and removable data drives**
          
          BitLocker can be used to encrypt the entire contents of a data drive. Group Policy can be used to require BitLocker be enabled on a drive before the computer can write data to the drive. BitLocker can be configured with various unlock methods for data drives, and a data drive supports multiple unlock methods.
          
      - question: Does BitLocker support multifactor authentication?
        answer: Yes, BitLocker supports multifactor authentication for operating system drives. If BitLocker is enabled on a computer that has a TPM version 1.2 or later, additional forms of authentication can be used with the TPM protection.

      - question: What are the BitLocker hardware and software requirements?
        answer: |
          For requirements, see [System requirements](bitlocker-overview.md#system-requirements).
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > Dynamic disks aren't supported by BitLocker. Dynamic data volumes won't be displayed in the Control Panel. Although the operating system volume will always be displayed in the Control Panel, regardless of whether it's a Dynamic disk, if it's a dynamic disk it can't be protected by BitLocker.
           
      - question: Why are two partitions required? Why does the system drive have to be so large?
        answer: Two partitions are required to run BitLocker because pre-startup authentication and system integrity verification must occur on a separate partition from the encrypted operating system drive. This configuration helps protect the operating system and the information in the encrypted drive.

      - question: Which Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) does BitLocker support?
        answer: |
          BitLocker supports TPM version 1.2 or higher. BitLocker support for TPM 2.0 requires Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) for the device. 
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > TPM 2.0 isn't supported in Legacy and CSM Modes of the BIOS. Devices with TPM 2.0 must have their BIOS mode configured as Native UEFI only. The Legacy and Compatibility Support Module (CSM) options must be disabled. For added security, enable the Secure Boot feature.
          > 
          > Installed Operating System on hardware in legacy mode will stop the OS from booting when the BIOS mode is changed to UEFI. Use the tool [MBR2GPT](/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt) before changing the BIOS mode that will prepare the OS and the disk to support UEFI.
          
      - question: How can I tell if a computer has a TPM?
        answer: Beginning with Windows 10, version 1803, the TPM status can be checked in **Windows Defender Security Center** > **Device Security** > **Security processor details**. In previous versions of Windows, open the TPM MMC console (tpm.msc) and look under the **Status** heading. [**Get-TPM**](/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm?view=windowsserver2019-ps)** can also be run in PowerShell to get more details about the TPM on the current computer.

      - question: Can I use BitLocker on an operating system drive without a TPM?
        answer: |
          Yes, BitLocker can be enabled on an operating system drive without a TPM version 1.2 or higher, if the BIOS or UEFI firmware has the ability to read from a USB flash drive in the boot environment. BitLocker won't unlock the protected drive until BitLocker's own volume master key is first released by either the computer's TPM or by a USB flash drive containing the BitLocker startup key for that computer. However, computers without TPMs won't be able to use the system integrity verification that BitLocker can also provide.
          To help determine whether a computer can read from a USB device during the boot process, use the BitLocker system check as part of the BitLocker setup process. This system check performs tests to confirm that the computer can properly read from the USB devices at the appropriate time and that the computer meets other BitLocker requirements.
          
      - question: How do I obtain BIOS support for the TPM on my computer?
        answer: |
          Contact the computer manufacturer to request a Trusted Computing Group (TCG)-compliant BIOS or UEFI boot firmware that meets the following requirements:
          
          - It's compliant with the TCG standards for a client computer.
          - It has a secure update mechanism to help prevent a malicious BIOS or boot firmware from being installed on the computer.
          
      - question: What credentials are required to use BitLocker?
        answer: To turn on, turn off, or change configurations of BitLocker on operating system and fixed data drives, membership in the local **Administrators** group is required. Standard users can turn on, turn off, or change configurations of BitLocker on removable data drives.

      - question: What is the recommended boot order for computers that are going to be BitLocker-protected?
        answer: The computer's startup options should be configured to have the hard disk drive first in the boot order, before any other drives such as CD/DVD drives or USB drives. If the hard disk isn't first and the computer typically boots from the hard disk, then a boot order change may be detected or assumed when removable media is found during boot. The boot order typically affects the system measurement that is verified by BitLocker and a change in boot order will cause a prompt for the BitLocker recovery key. For the same reason, if a laptop is used with a docking station, ensure that the hard disk drive is first in the boot order both when the laptop is docked and undocked.
