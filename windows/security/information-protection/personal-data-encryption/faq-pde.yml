title: Frequently asked questions for Personal Data Encryption (PDE)
summary: |
  Here are some answers to common questions regarding Personal Data Encryption (PDE)

sections:
  - name: Single section - ignored
    questions:
      - question: Can PDE encrypt entire volumes or drives?
        answer: |
          No. PDE only encrypts specified files.

      - question: Is PDE a replacement for BitLocker?
        answer: |
          No. It's still recommended to encrypt all volumes with BitLocker Drive Encryption for increased security.

      - question: Can an IT admin specify which files should be encrypted?
        answer: |
          Yes, but it can only be done using the [PDE APIs](/uwp/api/windows.security.dataprotection.userdataprotectionmanager).

      - question: Do I need to use OneDrive as my backup provider?
        answer: |
          No. PDE doesn't have a requirement for a backup provider including OneDrive. However, backups are strongly recommended in case the keys used by PDE to decrypt files are lost. OneDrive is a recommended backup provider.

      - question: What is the relation between Windows Hello for Business and PDE?
        answer: |
          During user sign-on, Windows Hello for Business unlocks the keys that PDE uses to decrypt files.

      - question: Can a file be encrypted with both PDE and EFS at the same time?
        answer: |
          No. PDE and EFS are mutually exclusive.

      - question: Can PDE encrypted files be accessed after signing on via a Remote Desktop connection (RDP)?
        answer: |
          No. Accessing PDE encrypted files over RDP isn't currently supported.

      - question: Can PDE encrypted files be access via a network share?
        answer: |
          No. PDE encrypted files can only be accessed after signing on locally to Windows with Windows Hello for Business credentials.

      - question: How can it be determined if a file is encrypted with PDE?
        answer: |
          Encrypted files will show a padlock on the file's icon. Additionally, `cipher.exe` can be used to show the encryption state of the file.

      - question: Can users manually encrypt and decrypt files with PDE?
        answer: |
          Currently users can decrypt files manually but they can't encrypt files manually.

      - question: If a user signs into Windows with a password instead of Windows Hello for Business, will they be able to access their PDE encrypted files?
        answer: |
          No. The keys used by PDE to decrypt files are protected by Windows Hello for Business credentials and will only be unlocked when signing on with Windows Hello for Business PIN or biometrics.

      - question: What encryption method and strength does PDE use?
        answer: |
          PDE uses AES-CBC with a 256-bit key to encrypt files
