>Learn more about what features and functionality are supported in each Windows edition at [Compare Windows 10 Editions](https://www.microsoft.com/WindowsForBusiness/Compare).

Use Task Manager to check the context of your apps while running in Windows Information Protection (WIP) to make sure that your organization's policies are applied and running correctly.

## Viewing the Enterprise Context column in Task Manager
You need to add the Enterprise Context column to the **Details** tab of the Task Manager.

1. Make sure that you have an active Windows Information Protection policy deployed and turned on in your organization.

2. Open the Task Manager (taskmgr.exe), click the **Details** tab, right-click in the column heading area, and click **Select columns**.

    The **Select columns** box appears.

3. Scroll down and check the **Enterprise Context** option, and then click **OK** to close the box.

    The **Enterprise Context** column should now be available in Task Manager.

## Review the Enterprise Context
The **Enterprise Context** column shows you what each app can do with your enterprise data:

- **Domain.** Shows the employee's work domain (such as, corp.contoso.com). This app is considered work-related and can freely touch and open work data and resources.

- **Personal.** Shows the text, *Personal*. This app is considered non-work-related and can't touch any work data or resources.

- **Exempt.** Shows the text, *Exempt*. Windows Information Protection policies don't apply to these apps (such as, system components).

  > [!Important]
  > Enlightened apps can change between Work and Personal, depending on the data being touched. For example, Microsoft Word 2016 shows as **Personal** when an employee opens a personal letter, but changes to **Work** when that same employee opens the company financials.
