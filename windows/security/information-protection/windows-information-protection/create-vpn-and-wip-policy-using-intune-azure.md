# Associate and deploy a VPN policy for Windows Information Protection (WIP) using Microsoft Intune

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1607 and later

After you've created and deployed your Windows Information Protection (WIP) policy, you can use Microsoft Intune to associate and deploy your Virtual Private Network (VPN) policy, linking it to your WIP policy.
 
## Associate your WIP policy to your VPN policy using Intune

To associate your WIP policy with your organization's existing VPN policy, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
3. Enter the following properties:

    - **Platform**: Select **Windows 10 and later**
    - **Profile**: Select **Templates** > **Custom**.

4. Select **Create**.
5. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name your profiles so you can easily identify them later. 
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended.

6. Select **Next**.
7. In **Configuration settings**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a name for your setting. For example, enter `EDPModeID`.
    - **OMA-URI**: Enter `./Vendor/MSFT/VPNv2/YourVPNProfileName/EDPModeId`.
    - **Data type**: Select `String`.
    - **Value**: Type your fully-qualified domain that should be used by the OMA-URI setting. For example, enter `corp.contoso.com`.

    For more information on these settings, see [Use custom settings for Windows devices in Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/custom-settings-windows-10).

8. Select **Next**, and continue configuring the policy. For the specific steps and recommendations, see [Create a profile with custom settings in Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/custom-settings-configure).

## Deploy your VPN policy using Microsoft Intune

After youâ€™ve created your VPN policy, you'll need to deploy it to the same group you deployed your Windows Information Protection (WIP) policy.

1.  On the **App policy** blade, select your newly-created policy, select **User groups** from the menu that appears, and then select **Add user group**.

    A list of user groups, made up of all of the security groups in your Azure Active Directory, appear in the **Add user group** blade.

2. Choose the group you want your policy to apply to, and then select **Select** to deploy the policy.

    The policy is deployed to the selected users' devices.
