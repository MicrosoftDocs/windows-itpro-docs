# Windows Defender Exploit Guard

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Windows Defender Exploit Guard (Windows Defender EG) is a new set of host intrusion prevention capabilities for Windows 10, allowing you to manage and reduce the attack surface of apps used by your employees.

There are four features in Windows Defender EG:

- [Exploit protection](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md) can apply exploit mitigation techniques to apps your organization uses, both individually and to all apps. Works with third-party antivirus solutions and Windows Defender Antivirus (Windows Defender AV).
- [Attack surface reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard.md) can reduce the attack surface of your applications with intelligent rules that stop the vectors used by Office-,  script- and mail-based malware. Requires Windows Defender AV. 
- [Network protection](network-protection-exploit-guard.md) extends the malware and social engineering protection offered by Windows Defender SmartScreen in Microsoft Edge to cover network traffic and connectivity on your organization's devices. Requires Windows Defender AV.
- [Controlled folder access](controlled-folders-exploit-guard.md) helps protect files in key system folders from changes made by malicious and suspicious apps, including file-encrypting ransomware malware. Requires Windows Defender AV.

Windows 10, version 1803 provides additional protections:

- New Attack surface reduction rules
- Controlled folder access can now block disk sectors

You can evaluate each feature of Windows Defender EG with the guides at the following link, which provide pre-built PowerShell scripts and testing tools so you can see the features in action:
- [Evaluate Windows Defender Exploit Guard](evaluate-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md)


You can also [enable audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) for the features, which provides you with basic event logs that indicate how the feature would have responded if it had been fully enabled. This can be useful when evaluating the impact of Windows Defender EG and to help determine the impact of the features on your network's security.

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the features are working and see how each of them work.

Windows Defender EG can be managed and reported on in the Windows Security app as part of the Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection suite of threat mitigation, preventing, protection, and analysis technologies.

You can use the Windows Security app to obtain detailed reporting into events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../microsoft-defender-atp/investigate-alerts.md). You can [sign up for a free trial of Microsoft Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-docs-msa4053440) to see how it works.
