# Memory integrity


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1709
- Windows Server 2016

Memory integrity is a powerful system mitigation that leverages hardware virtualization and the Windows Hyper-V hypervisor to protect Windows kernel-mode processes against the injection and execution of malicious or unverified code. Code integrity validation is performed in a secure environment that is resistant to attack from malicious software, and page permissions for kernel mode are set and maintained by the Hyper-V hypervisor. Memory integrity helps block many types of malware from running on computers that run Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.
