# Comparison between Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit and Windows Defender

**Applies to:**

* [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are currently using EMET, you should be aware that [EMET reached end of life on July 31, 2018](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2016/11/03/beyond-emet/). You should consider replacing EMET with exploit protection in Microsoft Defender ATP.
>
> You can [convert an existing EMET configuration file into Exploit protection](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md#convert-an-emet-configuration-file-to-an-exploit-protection-configuration-file) to make the migration easier and keep your existing settings.

This topic describes the differences between the Enhance Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and exploit protection in Microsoft Defender ATP.

Exploit protection in Microsoft Defender ATP is our successor to EMET and provides stronger protection, more customization, an easier user interface, and better configuration and management options.

EMET is a standalone product for earlier versions of Windows and provides some mitigation against older, known exploit techniques.

After July 31, 2018, it will not be supported.

For more information about the individual features and mitigations available in Microsoft Defender ATP, as well as how to enable, configure, and deploy them to better protect your network, see the following topics:

* [Protect devices from exploits](exploit-protection.md)
* [Configure and audit exploit protection mitigations](customize-exploit-protection.md)

## Mitigation comparison

The mitigations available in EMET are included in Windows Defender, under the [exploit protection feature](exploit-protection.md).

The table in this section indicates the availability and support of native mitigations between EMET and Exploit protection.

> [!NOTE]
> The Advanced ROP mitigations that are available in EMET are superseded by ACG in Windows 10, which other EMET advanced settings are enabled by default in Windows Defender as part of enabling the anti-ROP mitigations for a process.
