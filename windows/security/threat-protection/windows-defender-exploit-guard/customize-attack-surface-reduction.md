# Customize attack surface reduction rules

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Attack surface reduction rules help prevent actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. Attack surface reduction rules are supported on Windows Server 2019 as well as Windows 10 clients.

This topic describes how to customize attack surface reduction rules by [excluding files and folders](#exclude-files-and-folders) or [adding custom text to the notification](#customize-the-notification) alert that appears on a user's computer.

You can use Group Policy, PowerShell, and MDM CSPs to configure these settings.

## Exclude files and folders

You can exclude files and folders from being evaluated by all attack surface reduction rules. This means that even if the file or folder contains malicious behavior as determined by an attack surface reduction rule, the file will not be blocked from running. 

This could potentially allow unsafe files to run and infect your devices.

>[!WARNING]
>Excluding files or folders can severely reduce the protection provided by attack surface reduction rules. Files that would have been blocked by a rule will be allowed to run, and there will be no report or event recorded.
> 
>If you are encountering problems with rules detecting files that you believe should not be detected, you should [use audit mode first to test the rule](enable-attack-surface-reduction.md#enable-and-audit-attack-surface-reduction-rules).

You can specify individual files or folders (using folder paths or fully qualified resource names) but you cannot specify if the exclusions should only be applied to individual rules: the exclusions will apply to all rules that are enabled (or placed in audit mode) and that allow exclusions.

Attack surface reduction supports environment variables and wildcards. For information about using wildcards, see [Use wildcards in the file name and folder path or extension exclusion lists](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configure-extension-file-exclusions-windows-defender-antivirus#use-wildcards-in-the-file-name-and-folder-path-or-extension-exclusion-lists). 

Exclusions apply to all attack surface reduction rules.

See the [attack surface reduction](attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard.md) topic for details on each rule.

### Use Group Policy to exclude files and folders

1.  On your Group Policy management computer, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

2.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration** and click **Administrative templates**.

3.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Windows Defender Exploit Guard > Attack surface reduction**.

4. Double-click the **Exclude files and paths from Attack surface reduction Rules** setting and set the option to **Enabled**. Click **Show** and enter each file or folder in the **Value name** column. Enter **0** in the **Value** column for each item. 

### Use PowerShell to exclude files and folderss

1. Type **powershell** in the Start menu, right click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**
2. Enter the following cmdlet:

    ```PowerShell
    Add-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionOnlyExclusions "<fully qualified path or resource>"
    ```

Continue to use `Add-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionOnlyExclusions` to add more folders to the list. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Use `Add-MpPreference` to append or add apps to the list. Using the `Set-MpPreference` cmdlet will overwrite the existing list. 

### Use MDM CSPs to exclude files and folders

Use the [./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/AttackSurfaceReductionOnlyExclusions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-attacksurfacereductiononlyexclusions) configuration service provider (CSP) to add exclusions.

## Customize the notification

See the [Windows Security](../windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center.md#customize-notifications-from-the-windows-defender-security-center) topic for more information about customizing the notification when a rule is triggered and blocks an app or file.
