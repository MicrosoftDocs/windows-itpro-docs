# Understanding the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security Design Process

Designing any deployment starts by performing several important tasks:

-   [Identifying your windows defender firewall with advanced security design goals](identifying-your-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-deployment-goals.md)

-   [Mapping your implementation goals to a Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security design](mapping-your-deployment-goals-to-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design.md)


After you identify your implementation goals and map them to a Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security design, you can begin documenting the design based on the processes that are described in the following topics:

-   [Designing A Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy](designing-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-strategy.md)

-   [Planning Your Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security Design](planning-your-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design.md)
