# Determining the Trusted State of Your Devices


After obtaining information about the devices that are currently part of the IT infrastructure, you must determine at what point a device is considered trusted. The term *trusted* can mean different things to different people. Therefore, you must communicate a firm definition for it to all stakeholders in the project. Failure to do this communication can lead to problems with the security of the trusted environment, because the overall security can't exceed the level of security set by the least secure client that achieves trusted status.

>**Note:**  In this context, the term *trust* has nothing to do with an Active Directory trust relationship between domains. The trusted state of your devices just indicates the level of risk that you believe the device brings to the network. Trusted devices bring little risk whereas untrusted devices can potentially bring great risk.

## Trust states


To understand this concept, consider the four basic states that apply to devices in a typical IT infrastructure. These states are (in order of risk, lowest risk first):

-   Trusted

-   Trustworthy

-   Known, untrusted

-   Unknown, untrusted

The remainder of this section defines these states and how to determine which devices in your organization belong in each state.

### Trusted state

Classifying a device as trusted means that the device's security risks are managed, but it doesn't imply that it's perfectly secure or invulnerable. The responsibility for this managed state falls to the IT and security administrators, in addition to the users who are responsible for the configuration of the device. A trusted device that is poorly managed will likely become a point of weakness for the network.

When a device is considered trusted, other trusted devices can reasonably assume that the device won't initiate a malicious act. For example, trusted devices can expect that other trusted devices won't run a virus that attacks them, because all trusted devices are required to use mechanisms (such as antivirus software) to mitigate the threat of viruses.

Spend some time defining the goals and technology requirements that your organization considers appropriate as the minimum configuration for a device to obtain trusted status.

A possible list of technology requirements might include:

-   **Operating system.** A trusted client device should run at least Windows Vista. A trusted server should run at least Windows Server 2008.

-   **Domain membership.** A trusted device will belong to a managed Active Directory domain, which means that the IT department has security management rights and can configure member devices by using Group Policy.

-   **Management client.** All trusted devices must run a specific network management client to allow for centralized management and control of security policies, configurations, and software. Configuration Manager is one such management system with an appropriate client.

-   **Antivirus software.** All trusted devices will run antivirus software that is configured to check for and automatically update the latest virus signature files daily.

-   **File system.** All trusted devices will be configured to use the NTFS file system.

-   **BIOS settings.** All trusted portable devices will be configured to use a BIOS-level password that is under the management of the IT support team.

-   **Password requirements.** Trusted clients must use strong passwords.

It's important to understand that the trusted state isn't constant; it's a transient state that is subject to changing security standards and compliance with those standards. New threats and new defenses emerge constantly. For this reason, the organization's management systems must continually check the trusted devices to ensure ongoing compliance. Additionally, the management systems must be able to issue updates or configuration changes if they're required to help maintain the trusted status.

A device that continues to meet all these security requirements can be considered trusted. However it's possible that most devices that were identified in the discovery process discussed earlier don't meet these requirements. Therefore, you must identify which devices can be trusted and which ones can't. To help with this process, you use the intermediate *trustworthy* state. The remainder of this section discusses the different states and their implications.

### Trustworthy state

It's useful to identify as soon as possible those devices in your current infrastructure that can achieve a trusted state. A *trustworthy state* can be assigned to indicate that the current device can physically achieve the trusted state with required software and configuration changes.

For each device that is assigned a trustworthy status, make an accompanying configuration note that states what is required to enable the device to achieve trusted status. This information is especially important to both the project design team (to estimate the costs of adding the device to the solution) and the support staff (to enable them to apply the required configuration).

Generally, trustworthy devices fall into one of the following two groups:

-   **Configuration required.** The current hardware, operating system, and software enable the device to achieve a trustworthy state. However, more configuration changes are required. For example, if the organization requires a secure file system before a device can be considered trusted, a device that uses a FAT32-formatted hard disk doesn't meet this requirement.

-   **Upgrade required.** These devices require upgrades before they can be considered trusted. The following list provides some examples of the type of upgrade these devices might require:

    -   **Operating system upgrade required.** If the device's current operating system can't support the security needs of the organization, an upgrade would be required before the device could achieve a trusted state.

    -   **Software required.** A device that is missing a required security application, such as an antivirus scanner or a management client, can't be considered trusted until these applications are installed and active.

    -   **Hardware upgrade required.** In some cases, a device might require a specific hardware upgrade before it can achieve trusted status. This type of device usually needs an operating system upgrade or another software that forces the required hardware upgrade. For example, security software might require more hard disk space on the device.

    -   **Device replacement required.** This category is reserved for devices that can't support the security requirements of the solution because their hardware can't support the minimum acceptable configuration. For example, a device that can't run a secure operating system because it has an old processor (such as a 100 megahertz \[MHz\] x86-based device).

Use these groups to assign costs for implementing the solution on the devices that require upgrades.

### Known, untrusted state

During the process of categorizing an organization's devices, you'll identify some devices that can't achieve trusted status for specific well-understood and well-defined reasons. These reasons might include the following types:

-   **Financial.** The funding isn't available to upgrade the hardware or software for this device.

-   **Political.** The device must remain in an untrusted state because of a political or business situation that doesn't enable it to comply with the stated minimum security requirements of the organization. It's highly recommended that you contact the business owner or independent software vendor (ISV) for the device to discuss the added value of server and domain isolation.

-   **Functional.** The device must run a nonsecure operating system or must operate in a nonsecure manner to perform its role. For example, the device might be required to run an older operating system because a specific line of business application will only work on that operating system.

There can be multiple functional reasons for a device to remain in the known untrusted state. The following list includes several examples of functional reasons that can lead to a classification of this state:

-   **Devices that run unsupported versions of Windows.** These versions include Windows XP, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows 98, Windows 95, or Windows NT. Devices that run these versions of the Windows operating system can't be classified as trustworthy because these operating systems don't support the required security infrastructure. For example, although Windows NT does support a basic security infrastructure, it doesn't support “deny” ACLs on local resources, any way to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of network communications, smart cards for strong authentication, or centralized management of device configurations (although limited central management of user configurations is supported).

-   **Stand-alone devices.** Devices running any version of Windows which are configured as stand-alone devices or as members of a workgroup usually can't achieve a trustworthy state. Although these devices fully support the minimum required basic security infrastructure, the required security management capabilities are unlikely to be available when the device isn't a part of a trusted domain.

-   **Devices in an untrusted domain.** A device that is a member of a domain that isn't trusted by an organization's IT department can't be classified as trusted. An untrusted domain is a domain that can't provide the required security capabilities to its members. Although the operating systems of devices that are members of this untrusted domain might fully support the minimum required basic security infrastructure, the required security management capabilities can't be fully guaranteed when devices aren't in a trusted domain.

### Unknown, untrusted state

The unknown, untrusted state should be considered the default state for all devices. Because devices in this state have a configuration that is unknown, you can assign no trust to them. All planning for devices in this state must assume that the device is an unacceptable risk to the organization. Designers of the solution should strive to minimize the impact that the devices in this state can have on their organizations.

## Capturing upgrade costs for current devices


The final step in this part of the process is to record the approximate cost of upgrading the devices to a point that they can participate in the server and domain isolation design. You must make several key decisions during the design phase of the project that require answers to the following questions:

-   Does the device meet the minimum hardware requirements necessary for isolation?

-   Does the device meet the minimum software requirements necessary for isolation?

-   What configuration changes must be made to integrate this device into the isolation solution?

-   What is the projected cost or impact of making the proposed changes to enable the device to achieve a trusted state?

By answering these questions, you can quickly determine the level of effort and approximate cost of bringing a particular device or group of devices into the scope of the project. It's important to remember that the state of a device is transitive, and that by performing the listed remedial actions you can change the state of a device from untrusted to trusted. After you decide whether to place a device in a trusted state, you're ready to begin planning and designing the isolation groups, which the next section [Planning Domain Isolation Zones](planning-domain-isolation-zones.md) discusses.

The following table is an example of a data sheet that you could use to help capture the current state of a device and what would be required for the device to achieve a trusted state.

| Device name | Hardware reqs met | Software reqs met | Configuration required | Details | Projected cost |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| CLIENT001 | No| No| Upgrade hardware and software.| Current operating system is Windows XP. Old hardware isn't compatible with newer versions of Windows.| $??| 
| SERVER001 | Yes| No| Join trusted domain and upgrade from Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2012.| No antivirus software present.| $??| 

In the previous table, the device CLIENT001 is currently "known, untrusted" because its hardware must be upgraded. However, it could be considered trustworthy if the required upgrades are possible. However, if many devices require the same upgrades, the overall cost of the solution would be much higher.

The device SERVER001 is "trustworthy" because it meets the hardware requirements but its operating system must be upgraded. It also requires antivirus software. The projected cost is the amount of effort that is required to upgrade the operating system and install antivirus software, along with their purchase costs.

With the other information that you've gathered in this section, this information will be the foundation of the efforts performed later in the [Planning Domain Isolation Zones](planning-domain-isolation-zones.md) section.

The costs identified in this section only capture the projected cost of the device upgrades. Many more design, support, test, and training costs should be accounted for in the overall project plan.
