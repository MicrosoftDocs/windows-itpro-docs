# Gathering the Information You Need


Before starting the planning process for a Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security deployment, you must collect and analyze up-to-date information about the network, the directory services, and the devices that are already deployed in the organization. This information enables you to create a design that accounts for all possible elements of the existing infrastructure. If the gathered information isn't accurate, problems can occur when devices and devices that weren't considered during the planning phase are encountered during implementation.

Review each of the following articles for guidance about the kinds of information that you must gather:

-   [Gathering Information about Your Conversational Network Infrastructure](gathering-information-about-your-current-network-infrastructure.md)

-   [Gathering Information about Your Active Directory Deployment](gathering-information-about-your-active-directory-deployment.md)

-   [Gathering Information about Your Devices](gathering-information-about-your-devices.md)
