# Restrict Access to Only Specified Users or Computers


Domain isolation (as described in the previous goal [Restrict Access to Only Trusted Devices](restrict-access-to-only-trusted-devices.md)) prevents devices that are members of the isolated domain from accepting network traffic from untrusted devices. However, some devices on the network might host sensitive data that must be additionally restricted to only those users and computers that have a business requirement to access the data.

Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security enables you to restrict access to devices and users that are members of domain groups authorized to access that device. These groups are called *network access groups (NAGs)*. When a device authenticates to a server, the server checks the group membership of the computer account and the user account, and grants access only if membership in the NAG is confirmed. Adding this check creates a virtual "secure zone" within the domain isolation zone. You can have multiple devices in a single secure zone, and it's likely that you'll create a separate zone for each set of servers that have specific security access needs. Devices that are part of this server isolation zone are often also part of the encryption zone (see [Require Encryption When Accessing Sensitive Network Resources](require-encryption-when-accessing-sensitive-network-resources.md)).

Restricting access to only users and devices that have a business requirement can help you comply with regulatory and legislative requirements, such as those found in the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and other government and industry regulations.

You can restrict access by specifying either computer or user credentials.

The following illustration shows an isolated server, and examples of devices that can and can't communicate with it. Devices that are outside the Woodgrove corporate network, or computers that are in the isolated domain but aren't members of the required NAG, can't communicate with the isolated server.

This goal, which corresponds to [Server Isolation Policy Design](server-isolation-policy-design.md), provides the following features:

-   Isolated servers accept unsolicited inbound network traffic only from devices or users that are members of the NAG.

-   Isolated servers can be implemented as part of an isolated domain, and treated as another zone. Members of the zone group receive a GPO with rules that require authentication, and that specify that only network traffic authenticated as coming from a member of the NAG is allowed.

-   Server isolation can also be configured independently of an isolated domain. To do so, configure only the devices that must communicate with the isolated server with connection security rules to implement authentication and check NAG membership.

-   A server isolation zone can be simultaneously configured as an encryption zone. To do so, configure the GPO with rules that force encryption in addition to requiring authentication and restricting access to NAG members. For more information, see [Require Encryption When Accessing Sensitive Network Resources](require-encryption-when-accessing-sensitive-network-resources.md).

The following components are required for this deployment goal:

-   **Active Directory**: Active Directory supports centralized management of connection security rules by configuring the rules in one or more GPOs that can be automatically applied to all relevant devices in the domain.
