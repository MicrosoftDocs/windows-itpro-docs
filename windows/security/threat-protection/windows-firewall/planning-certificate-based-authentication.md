# Planning Certificate-based Authentication


Sometimes a device can't join an Active Directory domain, and therefore can't use Kerberos V5 authentication with domain credentials. However, the device can still participate in the isolated domain by using certificate-based authentication.

The non-domain member server, and the clients that must be able to communicate with it, must be configured to use cryptographic certificates based on the X.509 standard. These certificates can be used as an alternate set of credentials. During IKE negotiation, each device sends a copy of its certificate to the other device. Each device examines the received certificate, and then validates its authenticity. To be considered authentic, the received certificate must be validated by a certification authority certificate in the recipient's Trusted Root Certification Authorities store on the local device.

Certificates can be acquired from commercial firms, or by an internal certificate server set up as part of the organization's public key infrastructure (PKI). Microsoft provides a complete PKI and certification authority solution with Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008 Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).

## Deploying certificates

No matter how you acquire your certificates, you must deploy them to clients and servers that require them in order to communicate.

### Using Active Directory Certificate Services

If you use AD CS to create your own user and device certificates in-house, then the servers designated as certification authorities (CAs) create the certificates based on administrator-designed templates. AD CS then uses Group Policy to deploy the certificates to domain member devices. Device certificates are deployed when a domain member device starts. User certificates are deployed when a user logs on.

If you want non-domain member devices to be part of a server isolation zone that requires access by only authorized users, make sure to include certificate mapping to associate the certificates with specific user accounts. When certificate mapping is enabled, the certificate issued to each device or user includes enough identification information to enable IPsec to match the certificate to both user and device accounts.

AD CS automatically ensures that certificates issued by the CAs are trusted by the client devices by putting the CA certificates in the correct store on each domain member device.

### Using a commercially purchased certificate for devices running Windows

You can import the certificates manually onto each device if the number of devices is relatively small. For a deployment to more than a handful of devices, use Group Policy.

You must first download the vendor's root CA certificate, and then import it to a GPO that deploys it to the Local Computer\\Trusted Root Certification Authorities store on each device that applies the GPO.

You must also import the purchased certificate into a GPO that deploys it to the Local Computer\\Personal store on each device that applies the GPO.

### Using a commercially purchased certificate for devices running a non-Windows operating system

If you're installing the certificates on an operating system other than Windows, see the documentation for that operating system.

## Configuring IPsec to use the certificates

When the clients and servers have the certificates available, you can configure the IPsec and connection security rules to include those certificates as a valid authentication method. The authentication method requires the subject name of the certificate, for example: **DC=com,DC=woodgrovebank,CN=CorporateCertServer**. Optionally, select **Enable certificate to account mapping** to support using these credentials for restricting access to users or devices that are members of authorized groups in a server isolation solution.

Starting in Windows Server 2012, you can configure certificate selection criteria so the desired certificate is selected and/or validated. extended key usage (EKU) criteria can be configured, and name restrictions and certificate thumbprints. This EKU is configured using the **Advanced** button when choosing certificates for the authentication method in the user interface, or through Windows PowerShell.
