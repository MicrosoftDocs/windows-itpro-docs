# Open the Group Policy Management Console to IP Security Policies


Procedures in this guide that refer to GPOs for earlier versions of the Windows operating system instruct you to work with the IP Security Policy section in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).

2. In the navigation pane, expand **Forest:** *YourForestName*, expand **Domains**, expand *YourDomainName*, expand **Group Policy Objects**, right-click the GPO you want to modify, and then click **Edit**.

3. In the navigation pane of the Group Policy Management Editor, expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Policies**, expand **Windows Settings**, expand **Security Settings**, and then click **IP Security Policies on Active Directory (**<em>YourDomainName</em>**)**.
