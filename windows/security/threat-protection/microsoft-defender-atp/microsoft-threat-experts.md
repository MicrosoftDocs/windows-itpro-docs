Microsoft Threat Experts is a managed threat hunting service that provides your Security Operation Centers (SOCs) with expert level monitoring and analysis to help them ensure that critical threats in your unique environments don’t get missed.
  
This managed threat hunting service provides expert-driven insights and data through these two capabilities: targeted attack notification and access to experts on demand.

See [Configure Microsoft Threat Experts capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-microsoft-threat-experts#before-you-begin) for details. 

## Targeted attack notification 
Microsoft Threat Experts provides proactive hunting for the most important threats to your network, including human adversary intrusions, hands-on-keyboard attacks, or advanced attacks like cyberespionage. These notifications shows up as a new alert. The managed hunting service includes:  
- Threat monitoring and analysis, reducing dwell time and risk to the business 
- Hunter-trained artificial intelligence to discover and prioritize both known and unknown attacks  
- Identifying the most important risks, helping SOCs maximize time and energy 
- Scope of compromise and as much context as can be quickly delivered to enable fast SOC response. 
 
## Collaborate with experts, on demand 
Customers can engage our security experts directly from within Microsoft Defender Security Center for timely and accurate response. Experts provide insights needed to better understand the complex threats affecting your organization, from alert inquiries, potentially compromised devices, root cause of a suspicious network connection, to additional threat intelligence regarding ongoing advanced persistent threat campaigns. With this capability, you can:
- Get additional clarification on alerts including root cause or scope of the incident 
- Gain clarity into suspicious device behavior and next steps if faced with an advanced attacker  
- Determine risk and protection regarding threat actors, campaigns, or emerging attacker techniques 

The option to **Consult a threat expert** is available in several places in the portal so you can engage with experts in the context of your investigation:
