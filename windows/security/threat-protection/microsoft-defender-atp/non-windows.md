Microsoft has been on a journey to extend its industry leading endpoint security
capabilities beyond Windows and Windows Server to macOS, Linux, Android, and
soon iOS.

Organizations face threats across a variety of platforms and devices. Our teams
have committed to building security solutions not just *for* Microsoft, but also
*from* Microsoft to enable our customers to protect and secure their
heterogenous environments. We're listening to customer feedback and partnering
closely with our customers to build solutions that meet their needs.

With Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, customers benefit from a unified view of all
threats and alerts in the Microsoft Defender Security Center, across Windows and
non-Windows platforms, enabling them to get a full picture of what's happening
in their environment, which empowers them to more quickly assess and respond to
threats.
