# Exposure score
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Your exposure score reflects how vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. 

The widget also gives you a high-level view of your exposure score trend over time. Any spikes in the chart gives you a visual indication of a high cybersecurity threat exposure so you can investigate what happened on that date further.

## How it works

Several factors affect your organization exposure score: 
> Weakness discovered on the device
> Likelihood of a device getting breached
> Value of the device to the organization
> Relevant alert discovered on the device

Reduce the exposure score by addressing what needs to be remediated based on the prioritized security recommendations. See [Security recommendations](tvm-security-recommendation.md) for details.
