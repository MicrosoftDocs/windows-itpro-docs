## MICROSOFT APPLICATION LICENSE TERMS: MICROSOFT DEFENDER FOR ENDPOINT

These license terms ("Terms") are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or
based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They
apply to the application named above. These Terms also apply to any Microsoft

-   updates,

-   supplements,

-   Internet-based services, and

-   support services

for this application, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those
terms apply.

**BY USING THE APPLICATION, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM,
DO NOT USE THE APPLICATION.**

**If you comply with these Terms, you have the perpetual rights below.**

1.  **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

    1.  **Installation and Use.** You may install and use any number of copies
        of this application on iOS enabled device or devices that you own
        or control. You may use this application with your company's valid
        subscription of Defender for Endpoint or
        an online service that includes Microsoft Defender for Endpoint functionalities.

    2.  **Updates.** Updates or upgrades to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint may be required for full
        functionality. Some functionality may not be available in all countries.

    3.  **Third-Party Programs.** The application may include third-party
        programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this
        agreement. Notices, if any, for the third-party program are included for
        your information only.

2.  **INTERNET ACCESS MAY BE REQUIRED.** You may incur charges related to
    Internet access, data transfer, and other services per the terms of the data
    service plan and any other agreement you have with your network operator due
    to use of the application. You are solely responsible for any network
    operator charges.

3.  **INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.** Microsoft provides Internet-based services with
    the application. It may change or cancel them at any time.

    1.  Consent for Internet-Based or Wireless Services. The application may
        connect to Internet-based wireless services. Your use of the application
        operates as your consent to the transmission of standard device
        information (including but not limited to technical information about
        your device, system and application software, and peripherals) for
        Internet-based or wireless services. If other terms are provided with your use of the services, those terms also apply.

        -   Data. Some online services require, or may be enhanced by, the
            installation of local software like this one. At your, or your
            admin's direction, this software may send data from a device to or
            from an online service.

        -   Usage Data. Microsoft automatically collects usage and performance
            data over the internet. This data will be used to provide and
            improve Microsoft products and services and enhance your experience.
            You may limit or control collection of some usage and performance
            data through your device settings. Doing so may disrupt your use of
            certain features of the application. For more information on Microsoft's data collection and use, see the [Online Services
            Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2106777).

    2.  Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use any Internet-based
        service in any way that could harm it or impair anyone else's use of it
        or the wireless network. You may not use the service to try to gain
        unauthorized access to any service, data, account, or network by any
        means.

4.  **FEEDBACK.** If you give feedback about the application to Microsoft, you
    give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize
    your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third
    parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products,
    technologies, and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a
    Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give
    feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its
    software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback
    in them. These rights survive this agreement.

5.  **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The application is licensed, not sold. This agreement
    only gives you some rights to use the application. Microsoft reserves all
    other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
    limitation, you may use the application only as expressly permitted in this
    agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in
    the application that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

    -   work around any technical limitations in the application;

    -   reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the application, except and
        only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
        limitation;

    -   make more copies of the application than specified in this agreement or
        allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;

    -   publish the application for others to copy;

    -   rent, lease, or lend the application; or

    -   transfer the application or this agreement to any third party.

6.  **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The application is subject to United States export
    laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international
    export laws and regulations that apply to the application. These laws
    include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For more information, see [www.microsoft.com/exporting](https://www.microsoft.com/exporting).

7.  **SUPPORT SERVICES.** Because this application is "as is," we may not
    provide support services for it. If you have any issues or questions about
    your use of this application, including questions about your company's
    privacy policy, please contact your company's admin. Do not contact the
    application store, your network operator, device manufacturer, or Microsoft.
    The application store provider has no obligation to furnish support or
    maintenance with respect to the application.

8.  **APPLICATION STORE.**

    1.  If you obtain the application through an application store (for example, App 
        Store), review the applicable application store terms to ensure
        your download and use of the application complies with such terms.
        These terms are between you and Microsoft and not with
        the application store.

    2.  The respective application store provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these
        Terms, the application store provider(s) will have the right to directly
        enforce and rely upon any provision of these Terms that grants them a
        benefit or rights.

9.  **TRADEMARK NOTICES.** Microsoft, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and
    Microsoft 365 are registered or common-law trademarks of Microsoft
    Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.

10. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement and the terms for supplements, updates,
    Internet-based services, and support services that you use are the entire
    agreement for the application and support services.

11. **APPLICABLE LAW.**

    1.  **United States.** If you acquired the application in the United States,
        Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
        applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
        principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other
        claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
        competition laws, and in tort.

    2.  **Outside the United States.** If you acquired the application in any
        other country, the laws of that country apply.

12. **LEGAL EFFECT.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may
    have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights
    with respect to the party from whom you acquired the application. This
    agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the
    laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

13. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE APPLICATION IS LICENSED "AS-IS." "WITH ALL
    FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT AND
    WIRELESS CARRIERS OVER WHOSE NETWORK THE APPLICATION IS DISTRIBUTED, AND
    EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, AND SUPPLIERS ("COVERED PARTIES") GIVE NO
    EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS UNDER OR IN RELATION TO THE
    APPLICATION. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    APPLICATION IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE APPLICATION BE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
    ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING OR REPAIR. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL
    CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO
    THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, COVERED PARTIES EXCLUDE THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

    **FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.**

14.  **LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT NOT
    PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO
    ONE U.S. DOLLAR (\$1.00). YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO RECOVER ANY OTHER
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
    INCIDENTAL DAMAGES FROM ANY COVERED PARTIES.**

This limitation applies to:

-   anything related to the application, services, content (including code) on
    third-party Internet sites, or third-party programs; and

-   claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; consumer
    protection; deception; unfair competition; strict liability, negligence,
    misrepresentation, omission, trespass, or other tort; violation of statute or
    regulation; or unjust enrichment; all to the extent permitted by applicable
    law.

It also applies even if:

a.  Repair, replacement, or refund for the application does not fully compensate
    you for any losses; or

b.  Covered Parties knew or should have known about the possibility of the
    damages.

The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.
