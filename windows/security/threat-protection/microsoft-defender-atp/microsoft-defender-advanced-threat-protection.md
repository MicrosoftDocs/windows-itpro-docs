Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection is a platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

Microsoft Defender ATP uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

-   **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors
    collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender ATP.


-   **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and
    unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem,
    enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals
    are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses
    to advanced threats.

-   **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams,
    and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat
    intelligence enables Microsoft Defender ATP to identify attacker
    tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these
    are observed in collected sensor data.
