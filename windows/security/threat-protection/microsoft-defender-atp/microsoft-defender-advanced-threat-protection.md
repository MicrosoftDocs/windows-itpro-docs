>[!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE4wDob]

Microsoft Defender ATP uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

-   **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors
    collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender ATP.


-   **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and
    unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem,
    enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals
    are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses
    to advanced threats.

-   **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams,
    and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat
    intelligence enables Microsoft Defender ATP to identify attacker
    tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these
    are observed in collected sensor data.

**[Threat & Vulnerability Management](next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt.md)**<br>
This built-in capability uses a game-changing risk-based approach to the discovery, prioritization, and remediation of endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. 

<a name="asr"></a>

**[Attack surface reduction](overview-attack-surface-reduction.md)**<br>
The attack surface reduction set of capabilities provide the first line of defense in the stack. By ensuring configuration settings are properly set and exploit mitigation techniques are applied, these set of capabilities resist attacks and exploitation. This set of capabilities also includes [network protection](network-protection.md) and [web protection](web-protection-overview.md), which regulate access to malicious IP addresses, domains, and URLs.

**[Next generation protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10)**<br>
To further reinforce the security perimeter of your network, Microsoft Defender ATP uses next generation protection designed to catch all types of emerging threats.

<a name="edr"></a>

**[Endpoint detection and response](overview-endpoint-detection-response.md)**<br>
Endpoint detection and response capabilities are put in place to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats that may have made it past the first two security pillars. [Advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) provides a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you proactively find breaches and create custom detections.

<a name="ai"></a>

**[Automated investigation and remediation](automated-investigations.md)**<br>
In conjunction with being able to quickly respond to advanced attacks, Microsoft Defender ATP offers automatic investigation and remediation capabilities that help reduce the volume of alerts in minutes at scale.

**[Configuration score](configuration-score.md)**<br>
> [!NOTE]
> Secure score is now part of [Threat & Vulnerability Management](next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt.md) as [Configuration score](configuration-score.md).

Microsoft Defender ATP includes a configuration score to help you dynamically assess the security state of your enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve the overall security of your organization.
