# Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

[Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/05/23/new-browser-extensions-for-integrating-microsofts-hardware-based-isolation/) is a web browser add-on available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-guard-extensi/mfjnknhkkiafjajicegabkbimfhplplj/) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/application-guard-extension/).

[Microsoft Defender Application Guard](md-app-guard-overview.md) provides Hyper-V isolation on Windows 10 and Windows 11, to protect users from potentially harmful content on the web. The extension helps Application Guard protect users running other web browsers.

> [!TIP]
> Application Guard, by default, offers [native support](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard) to both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. These browsers do not need the extension described here for Application Guard to protect them.

Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension defends devices in your organization from advanced attacks, by redirecting untrusted websites to an isolated version of [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge). If an untrusted website turns out to be malicious, it remains within Application Guard's secure container, keeping the device protected.

## Prerequisites

Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension works with the following editions of Windows 10, version 1803 or later:

- Windows 10 Professional
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows 10 Education
- Windows 11

Application Guard itself is required for the extension to work. It has its own set of [requirements](reqs-md-app-guard.md). Check the Application Guard [installation guide](install-md-app-guard.md) for further steps, if you don't have it installed already.

## Installing the extension

Application Guard can be run under [managed mode](install-md-app-guard.md#enterprise-managed-mode) or [standalone mode](install-md-app-guard.md#standalone-mode). The main difference between the two modes is whether policies have been set to define the organization's boundaries.

Enterprise administrators running Application Guard under managed mode should first define Application Guard's [network isolation settings](configure-md-app-guard.md#network-isolation-settings), so a set of enterprise sites is already in place.

From there, the steps for installing the extension are similar whether Application Guard is running in managed or standalone mode.

1. On the local device, download and install the Application Guard extension for Google [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-guard-extensi/mfjnknhkkiafjajicegabkbimfhplplj/) and/or Mozilla [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/application-guard-extension/).
1. Install the [Microsoft Defender Application Guard companion app](https://www.microsoft.com/p/windows-defender-application-guard-companion/9n8gnlc8z9c8#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) from the Microsoft Store. This companion app enables Application Guard to work with web browsers other than Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.
1. Restart the device.

### Recommended browser group policies

Both Chrome and Firefox have their own browser-specific group policies. We recommend that admins use the following policy settings.

#### Chrome policies

These policies can be found along the filepath, `Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\`, with each policy name corresponding to the file name. For example, `IncognitoModeAvailability` is located at `Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\IncognitoModeAvailability`.

Policy name  | Values | Recommended setting | Reason
-|-|-|-
[IncognitoModeAvailability](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=IncognitoModeAvailability) | `0` = Enabled <br /> `1` = Disabled <br /> `2` = Forces pages to only open in Incognito mode | Disabled | This policy allows users to start Chrome in Incognito mode. In this mode, all extensions are turned off by default.
[BrowserGuestModeEnabled](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=BrowserGuestModeEnabled) | `false` or `0` = Disabled <br /> `true`, `1`, or not configured = Enabled | Disabled | This policy allows users to sign in as *Guest*, which opens a session in Incognito mode. In this mode, all extensions are turned off by default.
[BackgroundModeEnabled](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=BackgroundModeEnabled) | `false` or `0` = Disabled <br /> `true` or `1` = Enabled <br /> <br /> **Note:** If this policy isn't set, the user can enable or disable background mode through local browser settings. | Enabled | This policy keeps Chrome running in the background, ensuring that navigation is always passed to the extension.
[ExtensionSettings](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExtensionSettings) | This policy accepts a dictionary that configures multiple other management settings for Chrome. See the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExtensionSettings) for complete schema. | Include an entry for `force_installed` | This policy prevents users from manually removing the extension.

#### Firefox policies

These policies can be found along the filepath, `Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\`, with each policy name corresponding to the file name. Foe example, `DisableSafeMode` is located at `Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\DisableSafeMode`.

Policy name | Values | Recommended setting | Reason
-|-|-|-
[DisableSafeMode](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#DisableSafeMode) | `false` or `0` = Safe mode is enabled <br /> `true` or `1` = Safe mode is disabled | The policy is enabled and Safe mode isn't allowed to run. | Safe mode can allow users to circumvent Application Guard
[BlockAboutConfig](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#BlockAboutConfig) | `false` or `0` = User access to `about:config` is allowed <br /> `true` or `1` = User access to `about:config` isn't allowed | The policy is enabled and access to `about:config` isn't allowed. | `About:config` is a special page within Firefox that offers control over many settings that may compromise security
[Extensions - Locked](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#Extensions) | This setting accepts a list of UUIDs for extensions. You can find these extensions by searching `extensions.webextensions.uuids` within the `about:config` page) | Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions\Locked\1 = "`ApplicationGuardRel@microsoft.com`" | This setting allows you to lock the extension, so the user can't disable or uninstall it.
