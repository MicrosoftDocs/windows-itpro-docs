# System requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard

**Applies to** 

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

The threat landscape is continually evolving. While hackers are busy developing new techniques to breach enterprise networks by compromising workstations, phishing schemes remain one of the top ways to lure employees into social engineering attacks. Microsoft Defender Application Guard is designed to help prevent old, and newly emerging attacks, to help keep employees productive.

> [!NOTE]
> Given the technological complexity, the security promise of Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG) may not hold true on VMs and in VDI environments. Hence, MDAG is currently not officially supported on VMs and in VDI environments. However, for testing and automation purposes on non-production machines, you may enable MDAG on a VM by enabling Hyper-V nested virtualization on the host.

## Hardware requirements

Your environment must have the following hardware to run Microsoft Defender Application Guard.

| Hardware | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| 64-bit CPU|A 64-bit computer with minimum 4 cores (logical processors) is required for hypervisor and virtualization-based security (VBS). For more info about Hyper-V, see [Hyper-V on Windows Server 2016](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-on-windows-server) or [Introduction to Hyper-V on Windows 10](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/). For more info about hypervisor, see [Hypervisor Specifications](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/tlfs).|
| CPU virtualization extensions|Extended page tables, also called _Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)_ <p> **AND** <p> One of the following virtualization extensions for VBS:<br/>VT-x (Intel)<br/>**OR**<br/>AMD-V |
| Hardware memory | Microsoft requires a minimum of 8GB RAM |
| Hard disk | 5 GB free space, solid state disk (SSD) recommended |
| Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) support| Not required, but strongly recommended |

## Software requirements
