# Audit Application Generated

Audit Application Generated generates events for actions related to Authorization Manager [applications](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc770563(v=ws.11)).

Audit Application Generated subcategory is out of scope of this document, because [Authorization Manager](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc726036(v=ws.11)) is very rarely in use and it is deprecated starting from Windows Server 2012.
