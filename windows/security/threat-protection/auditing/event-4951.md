***Event Description:***

When you create or edit a Windows Firewall rule, the settings that you can include depend upon the version of Windows you use when creating the rule. As new settings are added to later versions of Windows or to service packs for existing versions of Windows, the version number of the rules processing engine is updated, and that version number is stamped into rules that are created by using that version of Windows. For example, Windows Vista produces firewall rules that are stamped with version "v2.0". Future versions of Windows might use "v2.1", or "v3.0" to indicate, respectively, minor or major changes and additions.

If you create a firewall rule on a newer version of Windows that references firewall settings that aren't available on earlier versions of Windows, and then try to deploy that rule to computers running the earlier version of Windows, the firewall engine produces this error to indicate that it can't process the rule.

The only solution is to remove the incompatible rule, and then deploy a compatible rule.
