# Audit Security Group Management


Audit Security Group Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific security group management tasks are performed.

**Event volume**: Low.

This subcategory allows you to audit events generated by changes to security groups such as the following:

- Security group is created, changed, or deleted.

- Member is added or removed from a security group.

- Group type is changed.

| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Domain Controller | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | We recommend Success auditing of security groups, to see new group creation events, changes and deletion of critical groups. Also you will get information about new members of security groups, when a member was removed from a group and when security group membership was enumerated. <br> This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |
| Member Server     | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | We recommend Success auditing of security groups, to see new group creation events, changes and deletion of critical groups. Also you will get information about new members of security groups, when a member was removed from a group and when security group membership was enumerated. <br> This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |
| Workstation       | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | We recommend Success auditing of security groups, to see new group creation events, changes and deletion of critical groups. Also you will get information about new members of security groups, when a member was removed from a group and when security group membership was enumerated. <br> This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |

**Events List:**

- [4731](event-4731.md)(S): A security-enabled local group was created.

- [4732](event-4732.md)(S): A member was added to a security-enabled local group.

- [4733](event-4733.md)(S): A member was removed from a security-enabled local group.

- [4734](event-4734.md)(S): A security-enabled local group was deleted.

- [4735](event-4735.md)(S): A security-enabled local group was changed.

- [4764](event-4764.md)(S): A group’s type was changed.

- [4799](event-4799.md)(S): A security-enabled local group membership was enumerated.

See event _[4731](event-4731.md): A security-enabled local group was created._ Event 4727 is the same, but it is generated for a **global** security group instead of a **local** security group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations are the same. The type of group is the only difference.
