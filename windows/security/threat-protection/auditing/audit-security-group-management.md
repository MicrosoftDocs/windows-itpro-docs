# Audit Security Group Management

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


Audit Security Group Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific security group management tasks are performed.

**Event volume**: Low.

This subcategory allows you to audit events generated by changes to security groups such as the following:

-   Security group is created, changed, or deleted.

-   Member is added or removed from a security group.

-   Group type is changed.

| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
