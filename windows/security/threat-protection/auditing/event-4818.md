***Required Server Roles:*** None.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that made an access request. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that made an access request.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Object**:

-   **Object Server** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: has “**Security**” value for this event.

-   **Object Type** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: The type of an object that was accessed during the operation. Always “**File**” for this event.

    The following table contains the list of the most common **Object Types**:

| Directory               | Event        | Timer                | Device       |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Mutant                  | Type         | File                 | Token        |
| Thread                  | Section      | WindowStation        | DebugObject  |
| FilterCommunicationPort | EventPair    | Driver               | IoCompletion |
| Controller              | SymbolicLink | WmiGuid              | Process      |
| Profile                 | Desktop      | KeyedEvent           | Adapter      |
| Key                     | WaitablePort | Callback             | Semaphore    |
| Job                     | Port         | FilterConnectionPort | ALPC Port    |

-   **Object Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: full path and name of the file or folder for which access was requested.

-   **Handle ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal value of a handle to **Object Name**. This field can help you correlate this event with other events that might contain the same Handle ID, for example, “[4663](event-4663.md)(S): An attempt was made to access an object.” This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “0x0”.

**Process Information:**

-   **Process ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process through which the access was requested. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):

    <img src="images/task-manager.png" alt="Task manager illustration" width="585" height="375" />

    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.

    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\New Process ID**.

-   **Process Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.

**Current Central Access Policy results:**

-   **Access Reasons** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of access check results for Current Access Policy. The format of the result is:<br><br>
REQUESTED\_ACCESS: RESULT ACE\_WHICH\_PROVIDED\_OR\_DENIED\_ACCESS.

The possible REQUESTED\_ACCESS values are listed in the table below.
