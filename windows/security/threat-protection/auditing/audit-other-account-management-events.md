# Audit Other Account Management Events


Audit Other Account Management Events determines whether the operating system generates user account management audit events.

**Event volume:** Typically Low on all types of computers.

This subcategory allows you to audit next events:

-   The password hash of a user account was accessed. This happens during an Active Directory Management Tool password migration.

-   The Password Policy Checking API was called. Password Policy Checking API allows an application to check password compliance against an application-provided account database or single account and verify that passwords meet the complexity, aging, minimum length, and history reuse requirements of a password policy.
