# Audit PNP Activity


Audit PNP Activity determines when Plug and Play detects an external device.

A PnP audit event can be used to track down changes in system hardware and will be logged on the machine where the change took place. For example, when a keyboard is plugged into a computer, a PnP event is triggered.

**Event volume**: Varies, depending on how the computer is used. Typically Low.

| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
