***Event Description:***

This event generates for new account logons if any of the following sensitive privileges are assigned to the new logon session:

-   SeTcbPrivilege - Act as part of the operating system

-   SeBackupPrivilege - Back up files and directories

-   SeCreateTokenPrivilege - Create a token object

-   SeDebugPrivilege - Debug programs

-   SeEnableDelegationPrivilege - Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation

-   SeAuditPrivilege - Generate security audits

-   SeImpersonatePrivilege - Impersonate a client after authentication

-   SeLoadDriverPrivilege - Load and unload device drivers

-   SeSecurityPrivilege - Manage auditing and security log

-   SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege - Modify firmware environment values

-   SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege - Replace a process-level token

-   SeRestorePrivilege - Restore files and directories,

-   SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege - Take ownership of files or other objects

You typically will see many of these events in the event log, because every logon of SYSTEM (Local System) account triggers this event.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account to which special privileges were assigned. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account to which special privileges were assigned.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Privileges** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the list of sensitive privileges, assigned to the new logon. The following table contains the list of possible privileges for this event:

| Privilege Name                | User Right Group Policy Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| SeBackupPrivilege             | Back up files and directories                                  | -   Required to perform backup operations. <br>With this privilege, the user can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system.<br>This privilege causes the system to grant all read access control to any file, regardless of the [*access control list*](/windows/win32/secgloss/a-gly#_security_access_control_list_gly) (ACL) specified for the file. Any access request other than read is still evaluated with the ACL. The following access rights are granted if this privilege is held:<br>READ\_CONTROL<br>ACCESS\_SYSTEM\_SECURITY<br>FILE\_GENERIC\_READ<br>FILE\_TRAVERSE                                                                                                                |
| SeCreateTokenPrivilege        | Create a token object                                          | Allows a process to create a token which it can then use to get access to any local resources when the process uses NtCreateToken() or other token-creation APIs.<br>When a process requires this privilege, we recommend using the LocalSystem account (which already includes the privilege), rather than creating a separate user account and assigning this privilege to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We recommend that SeDebugPrivilege always be granted to Administrators, and only to Administrators. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need this user right. Developers who are debugging new system components need this user right. This user right provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| SeEnableDelegationPrivilege   | Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation | Required to mark user and computer accounts as trusted for delegation.<br>With this privilege, the user can set the **Trusted for Deleg**ation setting on a user or computer object.<br>The user or object that is granted this privilege must have write access to the account control flags on the user or computer object. A server process running on a computer (or under a user context) that is trusted for delegation can access resources on another computer using the delegated credentials of a client, as long as the account of the client does not have the **Account cannot be delegated** account control flag set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 4672(S): Special privileges assigned to new logon.

> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).

-   Monitor for this event where “**Subject\\Security ID**” is *not* one of these well-known security principals: LOCAL SYSTEM, NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, and where “**Subject\\Security ID**” is not an administrative account that is expected to have the listed **Privileges**.

-   If you have a list of specific privileges which should never be granted, or granted only to a few accounts (for example, SeDebugPrivilege), use this event to monitor for those “**Privileges**.”

<!-- -->

-   If you are required to monitor any of the sensitive privileges in the [Event Description for this event](event-4672.md), search for those specific privileges in the event.
