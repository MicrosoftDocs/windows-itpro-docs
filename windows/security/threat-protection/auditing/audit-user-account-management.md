# Audit User Account Management


Audit User Account Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific user account management tasks are performed.

**Event volume**: Low.

This policy setting allows you to audit changes to user accounts. Events include the following:

-   A user account is created, changed, deleted, renamed, disabled, enabled, locked out or unlocked.

-   A user accountâ€™s password is set or changed.

-   A security identifier (SID) is added to the SID History of a user account, or fails to be added.

-   The Directory Services Restore Mode password is configured.

-   Permissions on administrative user accounts are changed.

-   A user's local group membership was enumerated.

-   Credential Manager credentials are backed up or restored.

Some events in this subcategory, for example 4722, 4725, 4724, and 4781, are also generated for computer accounts.
