***Subcategory:***&nbsp;[Audit Kerberos Authentication Service](audit-kerberos-authentication-service.md)

***Event Description:***

This event generates every time Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

This event generates only on domain controllers.

If TGT issue fails then you will see Failure event with **Result Code** field not equal to “**0x0**”.

This event doesn't generate for **Result Codes**: 0x10, 0x17 and 0x18. Event “[4771](event-4771.md): Kerberos pre-authentication failed.” generates instead.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.

***Required Server Roles:*** Active Directory domain controller.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Account Information:**

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of account, for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Computer account name ends with **$** character.

    -   User account example: dadmin

    -   Computer account example: WIN81$

-   **Supplied Realm Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the Kerberos Realm that **Account Name** belongs to. This can appear in a variety of formats, including the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **Kerberos Realm** is a set of managed nodes that share the same Kerberos database. The Kerberos database resides on the Kerberos master computer system, which should be kept in a physically secure room. Active Directory domain is the example of Kerberos Realm in the Microsoft Windows Active Directory world.

-   **User ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

    For example: CONTOSO\\dadmin or CONTOSO\\WIN81$.

    -   **NULL SID** – this value shows in [4768](event-4768.md) Failure events.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

**Service Information:**

-   **Service Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the name of the service in the Kerberos Realm to which TGT request was sent. Typically has value “**krbtgt”** for TGT requests, which means Ticket Granting Ticket issuing service.

    -   For Failure events **Service Name** typically has the following format: **krbtgt/REALM\_NAME**. For example: krbtgt/CONTOSO.

-   **Service ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of the service account in the Kerberos Realm to which TGT request was sent. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

    Domain controllers have a specific service account (**krbtgt**) that is used by the [Key Distribution Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa378170(v=vs.85).aspx) (KDC) service to issue Kerberos tickets. It has a built-in, pre-defined SID: S-1-5-21-[DOMAIN\_IDENTIFIER](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc962011.aspx)-502.

    -   **NULL SID** – this value shows in [4768](event-4768.md) Failure events.

**Network Information:**

-   **Client Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** IP address of the computer from which the TGT request was received. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   **IPv6** or **IPv4** address.

    -   **::ffff:IPv4\_address**.

    -   **::1** - localhost.

-   **Client Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: source port number of client network connection (TGT request connection).

    -   0 for local (localhost) requests.

**Additional information:**

-   **Ticket Options** \[Type = HexInt32\]: this is a set of different ticket flags in hexadecimal format.

    Example:

    -   Ticket Options: 0x40810010

    -   Binary view: 01000000100000010000000000010000

    -   Using **MSB 0** bit numbering we have bit 1, 8, 15 and 27 set = Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table below **“MSB 0”** bit numbering is used, because RFC documents use this style. In “MSB 0” style bit numbering begins from left.<br><img src="images/msb.png" alt="MSB illustration" width="224" height="57" />

The most common values:

-   0x40810010 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

-   0x40810000 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize

-   0x60810010 - Forwardable, Forwarded, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

This error can occur if the address of the computer sending the ticket is different from the valid address in the ticket. A possible cause of this could be an Internet Protocol (IP) address change. Another possible cause is when a ticket is passed through a proxy server or NAT. The client is unaware of the address scheme used by the proxy server, so unless the program caused the client to request a proxy server ticket with the proxy server's source address, the ticket could be invalid.                                              |

| **High-value accounts**: You might have high-value domain or local accounts for which you need to monitor each action.<br>Examples of high-value accounts are database administrators, built-in local administrator account, domain administrators, service accounts, domain controller accounts and so on. | Monitor this event with the **“User ID”** that corresponds to the high-value account or accounts.                                                              |
| **Anomalies or malicious actions**: You might have specific requirements for detecting anomalies or monitoring potential malicious actions. For example, you might need to monitor for use of an account outside of working hours.                                                                                | When you monitor for anomalies or malicious actions, use the **“User ID”** (with other information) to monitor how or when a particular account is being used. |

| **Account whitelist**: You might have a specific whitelist of accounts that are the only ones allowed to perform actions corresponding to particular events.                                                                                                                                                      | If this event corresponds to a “whitelist-only” action, review the **“User ID”** for accounts that are outside the whitelist.                                  |
| **External accounts**: You might be monitoring accounts from another domain, or “external” accounts that are not allowed to perform certain actions (represented by certain specific events).                                                                                                                     | Monitor this event for the **“Supplied Realm Name”** corresponding to another domain or “external” location.                                                   |
| **Account naming conventions**: Your organization might have specific naming conventions for account names.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Monitor “**User ID”** for names that don’t comply with naming conventions.                                                                                     |

-   You can track all [4768](event-4768.md) events where the **Client Address** is not from your internal IP range or not from private IP ranges.

-   If you know that **Account Name** should be used only from known list of IP addresses, track all **Client Address** values for this **Account Name** in [4768](event-4768.md) events. If **Client Address** is not from the whitelist, generate the alert.

-   All **Client Address** = ::1 means local authentication. If you know the list of accounts which should log on to the domain controllers, then you need to monitor for all possible violations, where **Client Address** = ::1 and **Account Name** is not allowed to log on to any domain controller.

-   All [4768](event-4768.md) events with **Client Port** field value &gt; 0 and &lt; 1024 should be examined, because a well-known port was used for outbound connection.

-   Also consider monitoring the fields shown in the following table, to discover the issues listed:

| **Field**                   | **Issue to discover**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Certificate Issuer Name** | Certification authority name is not from your PKI infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Certificate Issuer Name** | Certification authority name is not authorized to issue smart card authentication certificates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **0**, which means that pre-authentication was not used. All accounts should use Pre-Authentication, except accounts configured with “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication,” which is a security risk. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                         |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 15** when account must use a smart card for authentication. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 2** when only standard password authentication is in use in the organization. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 138** when Kerberos Armoring is enabled for all Kerberos communications in the organization. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                                                                                                                                  |
| **Ticket Encryption Type**  | Value is **0x1** or **0x3**, which means the DES algorithm was used. DES should not be in use, because of low security and known vulnerabilities. It is disabled by default starting from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see [Table 4. Kerberos encryption types](#kerberos-encryption-types).                             |
| **Ticket Encryption Type**  | Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, monitor for values **other than 0x11 and 0x12**. These are the expected values, starting with these operating systems, and represent AES-family algorithms. For more information, see [Table 4. Kerberos encryption types](#kerberos-encryption-types).                                            |
| **Result Code**             | **0x6** (The username doesn't exist), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This can be an indicator of account enumeration attack, especially for highly critical accounts.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Result Code**             | **0x7** (Server not found in Kerberos database). This error can occur if the domain controller cannot find the server's name in Active Directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Result Code**             | **0x8** (Multiple principal entries in KDC database). This will help you to find duplicate SPNs faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Result Code**             | **0x9** (The client or server has a null key (master key)). This error can help you to identify problems with Kerberos authentication faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Result Code**             | **0xA** (Ticket (TGT) not eligible for postdating). Microsoft systems should not request postdated tickets. These events could help identify anomaly activity.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Result Code**             | **0xC** (Requested start time is later than end time), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This can be an indicator of an account compromise attempt, especially for highly critical accounts.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Result Code**             | **0xE** (KDC has no support for encryption type). In general, this error occurs when the KDC or a client receives a packet that it cannot decrypt. Monitor for these events because this should not happen in a standard Active Directory environment.                                                                                                  |
| **Result Code**             | **0xF** (KDC has no support for checksum type). Monitor for these events because this should not happen in a standard Active Directory environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Result Code**             | **0x12** (Client's credentials have been revoked), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This can be an indicator of anomaly activity or brute-force attack, especially for highly critical accounts.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Result Code**             | **0x1F** (Integrity check on decrypted field failed). The authenticator was encrypted with something other than the session key. The result is that the KDC cannot decrypt the TGT. The modification of the message could be the result of an attack or it could be because of network noise.                                                           |
| **Result Code**             | **0x22** (The request is a replay). This error indicates that a specific authenticator showed up twice—the KDC has detected that this session ticket duplicates one that it has already received. It could be a sign of attack attempt.                                                                                                                 |
| **Result Code**             | **0x29** (Message stream modified and checksum didn't match). The authentication data was encrypted with the wrong key for the intended server. The authentication data was modified in transit by a hardware or software error, or by an attacker. Monitor for these events because this should not happen in a standard Active Directory environment. |
| **Result Code**             | **0x3C** (Generic error). This error can help you more quickly identify problems with Kerberos authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Result Code**             | **0x3E** (The client trust failed or is not implemented). This error helps you identify logon attempts with revoked certificates and the situations when the root Certification Authority that issued the smart card certificate (through a chain) is not trusted by a domain controller.                                                               |
| **Result Code**             | **0x3F**, **0x40**, **0x41** errors. These errors can help you more quickly identify smart-card related problems with Kerberos authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
