***Required Server Roles:*** Active Directory domain controller.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that requested the “create Computer object” operation. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “create Computer object” operation.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**New Computer Account:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of created computer account. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the computer account that was created. For example: WIN81$

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** domain name of created computer account. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

**Attributes:**

-   **SAM Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: logon name for account used to support clients and servers from previous versions of Windows (pre-Windows 2000 logon name). The value of **sAMAccountName** attribute of new computer object. For example: WIN81$.

-   **Display Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the value of **displayName** attribute of new computer object. It is a name displayed in the address book for a particular account (typically – user account). This is usually the combination of the user's first name, middle initial, and last name. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **User Principal Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: internet-style login name for the account, based on the Internet standard RFC 822. By convention this should map to the account's email name. This parameter contains the value of **userPrincipalName** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Home Directory** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: user's home directory. If **homeDrive** attribute is set and specifies a drive letter, **homeDirectory** should be a UNC path. The path must be a network UNC of the form \\\\Server\\Share\\Directory. This parameter contains the value of **homeDirectory** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Home Drive** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** specifies the drive letter to which to map the UNC path specified by **homeDirectory** account’s attribute. The drive letter must be specified in the form “DRIVE\_LETTER:”. For example – “H:”. This parameter contains the value of **homeDrive** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Script Path** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** specifies the path of the account's logon script. This parameter contains the value of **scriptPath** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Profile Path** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: specifies a path to the account's profile. This value can be a null string, a local absolute path, or a UNC path. This parameter contains the value of **profilePath** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **User Workstations** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: contains the list of NetBIOS or DNS names of the computers from which the user can logon. Each computer name is separated by a comma. The name of a computer is the **sAMAccountName** property of a computer object. This parameter contains the value of **userWorkstations** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Password Last Set** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** last time the account’s password was modified. For manually created computer account, using Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, this field typically has value “**&lt;never&gt;”**. For computer account created during standard domain join procedure this field will contains time when computer object was created, because password creates during domain join procedure. For example: 8/12/2015 11:41:39 AM. This parameter contains the value of **pwdLastSet** attribute of new computer object.

-   **Account Expires** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the date when the account expires. This parameter contains the value of **accountExpires** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Primary Group ID** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: Relative Identifier (RID) of computer’s object primary group.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Relative identifier (RID)** is a variable length number that is assigned to objects at creation and becomes part of the object's Security Identifier (SID) that uniquely identifies an account or group within a domain.

Typically, **Primary Group** field for new computer accounts has the following values:

-   516 (Domain Controllers) – for domain controllers.

-   521 (Read-only Domain Controllers) – for read-only domain controllers (RODC).

-   515 (Domain Computers) – for member servers and workstations.

    See this article <https://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330> for more information. This parameter contains the value of **primaryGroupID** attribute of new computer object.

<!-- -->

-   **AllowedToDelegateTo** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of SPNs to which this account can present delegated credentials. Can be changed using Active Directory Users and Computers management console in **Delegation** tab of computer account. Typically it is set to “**-“** for new computer objects. This parameter contains the value of **AllowedToDelegateTo** attribute of new computer object. See description of **AllowedToDelegateTo** field for “[4742](event-4742.md): A computer account was changed” event for more details.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Service Principal Name (SPN)** is the name by which a client uniquely identifies an instance of a service. If you install multiple instances of a service on computers throughout a forest, each instance must have its own SPN. A given service instance can have multiple SPNs if there are multiple names that clients might use for authentication. For example, an SPN always includes the name of the host computer on which the service instance is running, so a service instance might register an SPN for each name or alias of its host.

-   **Old UAC Value** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: specifies flags that control password, lockout, disable/enable, script, and other behavior for the user or computer account. **Old UAC value** always **“0x0”** for new computer accounts. This parameter contains the previous value of **userAccountControl** attribute of computer object.

-   **New UAC Value** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: specifies flags that control password, lockout, disable/enable, script, and other behavior for the user or computer account. This parameter contains the value of **userAccountControl** attribute of new computer object.

To decode this value, you can go through the property value definitions in the “Table 7. User’s or Computer’s account UAC flags.” from largest to smallest. Compare each property value to the flags value in the event. If the flags value in the event is greater than or equal to the property value, then the property is "set" and applies to that event. Subtract the property value from the flags value in the event and note that the flag applies and then go on to the next flag.

Here's an example: Flags value from event: 0x15

Decoding:

• PASSWD\_NOTREQD 0x0020

• LOCKOUT 0x0010

• HOMEDIR\_REQUIRED 0x0008

• (undeclared) 0x0004

• ACCOUNTDISABLE 0x0002

• SCRIPT 0x0001

0x0020 &gt; 0x15, so PASSWD\_NOTREQD does not apply to this event

0x10 &lt; 0x15, so LOCKOUT applies to this event. 0x15 - 0x10 = 0x5

0x4 &lt; 0x5, so the undeclared value is set. We'll pretend it doesn't mean anything. 0x5 - 0x4 = 0x1

0x2 &gt; 0x1, so ACCOUNTDISABLE does not apply to this event

0x1 = 0x1, so SCRIPT applies to this event. 0x1 - 0x1 = 0x0, we're done.

So this UAC flags value decodes to: LOCKOUT and SCRIPT

-   **User Account Control** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** shows the list of changes in **userAccountControl** attribute. You will see a line of text for each change. For new computer accounts, when the object for this account was created, the **userAccountControl** value was considered to be **“0x0”**, and then it was changed from **“0x0”** to the real value for the account's **userAccountControl** attribute. See possible values in the table below. In the “User Account Control field text” column, you can see the text that will be displayed in the **User Account Control** field in 4741 event.

-   **User Parameters** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: if you change any setting using Active Directory Users and Computers management console in Dial-in tab of computer’s account properties, then you will see **&lt;value changed, but not displayed&gt;** in this field in “[4742](event-4742.md)(S): A computer account was changed.” This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **SID History** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: contains previous SIDs used for the object if the object was moved from another domain. Whenever an object is moved from one domain to another, a new SID is created and becomes the objectSID. The previous SID is added to the **sIDHistory** property. This parameter contains the value of **sIDHistory** attribute of new computer object. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.

-   **Logon Hours** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: hours that the account is allowed to logon to the domain. The value of **logonHours** attribute of new computer object. For computer objects, it is optional, and typically is not set. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. You will see **&lt;value not set&gt;** value for new created computer accounts in event 4741.

-   **DNS Host Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: name of computer account as registered in DNS. The value of **dNSHostName** attribute of new computer object. For manually created computer account objects this field has value “**-**“.

-   **Service Principal Names** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** The list of SPNs, registered for computer account. For new computer accounts it will typically contain HOST SPNs and RestrictedKrbHost SPNs. The value of **servicePrincipalName** attribute of new computer object. For manually created computer objects it is typically equals “**-**“. This is an example of **Service Principal Names** field for new domain joined workstation**:**

    HOST/Win81.contoso.local

    RestrictedKrbHost/Win81.contoso.local

    HOST/WIN81

    RestrictedKrbHost/WIN81
