***Event Description:***

This event indicates that a handle was requested for either an Active Directory object or a Security Account Manager (SAM) object.

If access was declined, then Failure event is generated.

This event generates only if Success auditing is enabled for the [Audit Handle Manipulation](audit-handle-manipulation.md) subcategory.

***Required Server Roles:*** For an Active Directory object, the domain controller role is required. For a SAM object, there is no required role.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that requested a handle to an object. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that requested a handle to an object.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Object**:

-   **Object Server** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: has “**Security Account Manager**” value for this event.

-   **Object Type** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the type or class of the object that was accessed. The following list contains possible values for this field:

    -   SAM\_ALIAS - a local group.

    -   SAM\_GROUP - a group that is not a local group.

    -   SAM\_USER - a user account.

    -   SAM\_DOMAIN - a domain. For Active Directory events, this is the typical value.

    -   SAM\_SERVER - a computer account.

-   **Object Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the name of an object for which access was requested. Depends on **Object Type.** This event can have the following format:

    -   SAM\_ALIAS – SID of the group.

    -   SAM\_GROUP - SID of the group.

    -   SAM\_USER - SID of the account.

    -   SAM\_DOMAIN – distinguished name of the accessed object.

    -   SAM\_SERVER - distinguished name of the accessed object.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;The LDAP API references an LDAP object by its **distinguished name (DN)**. A DN is a sequence of relative distinguished names (RDN) connected by commas.
> 
> An RDN is an attribute with an associated value in the form attribute=value; . These are examples of RDNs attributes:
> 
> • DC - domainComponent
> 
> • CN - commonName
> 
> • OU - organizationalUnitName
> 
> • O - organizationName

-   **Handle ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal value of a handle to **Object Name**. This field can help you correlate this event with other events that might contain the same Handle ID, for example, “[4662](event-4662.md): An operation was performed on an object.” This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “0x0”.

**Process Information:**

-   **Process ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process that requested the handle. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):

    <img src="images/task-manager.png" alt="Task manager illustration" width="585" height="375" />

    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.

-   **Process Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.

**Access Request Information:**

-   **Transaction ID** \[Type = GUID\]: unique GUID of the transaction. This field can help you correlate this event with other events that might contain the same the **Transaction ID**, such as “[4660](event-4660.md)(S): An object was deleted.”

    This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}”.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**GUID** is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier'. It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources, activities or instances.

-   **Accesses** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of access rights which were requested by **Subject\\Security ID**. These access rights depend on **Object Type**. See “Table 13. File access codes.” for more information about file access rights. For information about SAM object access right use <https://technet.microsoft.com/> or other informational resources.

-   **Access Mask** \[Type = HexInt32\]: hexadecimal mask for the operation that was requested or performed. See “Table 13. File access codes.” for more information about file access rights. For information about SAM object access right use <https://technet.microsoft.com/> or other informational resources.

-   **Privileges Used for Access Check** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of user privileges which were used during the operation, for example, SeBackupPrivilege. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”. See full list of user privileges in the table below:

| Privilege Name                  | User Right Group Policy Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
