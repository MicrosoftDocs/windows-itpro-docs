# Security auditing

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

Topics in this section are for IT professionals and describes the security auditing features in Windows and how your organization can benefit from using these technologies to enhance the security and manageability of your network.

## <a href="" id="bkmk-over"></a>

Security auditing is one of the most powerful tools that you can use to maintain the integrity of your system. As part of your overall security strategy, you should determine the level of auditing that is appropriate for your environment. Auditing should identify attacks (successful or not) that pose a threat to your network, and attacks against resources that you have determined to be valuable in your risk assessment.

| Topic | Description |

|[Basic security audit policies](basic-security-audit-policies.md) |Before you implement auditing, you must decide on an auditing policy. A basic audit policy specifies categories of security-related events that you want to audit. When this version of Windows is first installed, all auditing categories are disabled. By enabling various auditing event categories, you can implement an auditing policy that suits the security needs of your organization. |
|[Advanced security audit policies](advanced-security-auditing.md) |Advanced security audit policy settings are found in **Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\System Audit Policies** and appear to overlap with basic security audit policies, but they are recorded and applied differently. |
