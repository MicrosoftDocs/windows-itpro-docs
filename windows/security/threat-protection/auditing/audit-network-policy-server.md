# Audit Network Policy Server


Audit Network Policy Server allows you to audit events generated by RADIUS (IAS) and Network Access Protection (NAP) activity related to user access requests. These requests can be Grant, Deny, Discard, Quarantine, Lock, and Unlock.

If you configure this subcategory, an audit event is generated for each IAS and NAP user access request.

This subcategory generates events only if NAS or IAS role is installed on the server.

NAP events can be used to help understand the overall health of the network.

**Event volume**: Medium to High on servers that are running [Network Policy Server](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc732912(v=ws.11)) (NPS).

Role-specific subcategories are outside the scope of this document.
