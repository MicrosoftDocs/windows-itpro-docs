# Audit Certification Services

Audit Certification Services determines whether the operating system generates events when Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) operations are performed.

Examples of AD CS operations include:

-   AD CS starts, shuts down, is backed up, or is restored.

-   Certificate revocation list (CRL)-related tasks are performed.

-   Certificates are requested, issued, or revoked.

-   Certificate manager settings for AD CS are changed.

-   The configuration and properties of the certification authority (CA) are changed.

-   AD CS templates are modified.

-   Certificates are imported.

-   A CA certificate is published to Active Directory Domain Services.

-   Security permissions for AD CS role services are modified.

-   Keys are archived, imported, or retrieved.

-   The OCSP Responder Service is started or stopped.

Monitoring these operational events is important to ensure that AD CS role services are functioning properly.

**Event volume: Low to medium on servers that provide AD CS role services.**

Role-specific subcategories are outside the scope of this document.
