# Audit User/Device Claims


Audit User/Device Claims allows you to audit user and device claims information in the account’s logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to.

For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.

***Important***: Enable the [Audit Logon](audit-logon.md) subcategory in order to get events from this subcategory.

**Event volume**:

-   Low on a client computer.

-   Medium on a domain controller or network servers.
