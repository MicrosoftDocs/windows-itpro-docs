# 5066(S, F): A cryptographic function operation was attempted.


This event generates in [BCryptAddContextFunction](/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptaddcontextfunction)() and [BCryptRemoveContextFunction](/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptremovecontextfunction)() functions. These functions are Cryptographic Next Generation (CNG) functions.

This event generates when cryptographic function was added or removed from the list of functions that are supported by an existing CNG context.
