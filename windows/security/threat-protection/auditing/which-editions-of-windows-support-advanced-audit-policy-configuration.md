# Which editions of Windows support advanced audit policy configuration


Advanced audit policy configuration is supported on all versions of Windows since it was introduced in Windows Vista.
There's no difference in security auditing support between 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
Windows editions that can't join a domain, such as Windows 10 Home edition, don't have access to these features.
