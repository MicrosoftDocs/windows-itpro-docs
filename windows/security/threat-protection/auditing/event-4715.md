***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that requested the “change local audit policy security descriptor (SACL)” operation. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “change local audit policy security descriptor (SACL)” operation.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Audit Policy Change:**

-   **Original Security Descriptor** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the old Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) value for the audit policy.

-   **New Security Descriptor** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** new Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) value for the audit policy.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;The ** Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)** defines string elements for enumerating information contained in the security descriptor.

> Example:

> *O*:BA*G*:SY*D*:(D;;0xf0007;;;AN)(D;;0xf0007;;;BG)(A;;0xf0007;;;SY)(A;;0×7;;;BA)*S*:ARAI(AU;SAFA;DCLCRPCRSDWDWO;;;WD)

> - *O*: = Owner. SID of specific security principal, or reserved (pre-defined) value, for example: BA (BUILTIN\_ADMINISTRATORS), WD (Everyone), SY (LOCAL\_SYSTEM), etc. 
> See the list of possible values in the table below:

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 4715(S): The audit policy (SACL) on an object was changed.

-   Monitor for all events of this type, especially on high value assets or computers, because any change of the local audit policy security descriptor should be planned. If this action was not planned, investigate the reason for the change.
