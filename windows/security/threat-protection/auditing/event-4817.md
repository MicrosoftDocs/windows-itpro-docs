***Event Description:***

This event generates when the [Global Object Access Auditing](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd772630(v=ws.10).aspx) policy is changed on a computer.

Separate events will be generated for “Registry” and “File system” policy changes.

***Required Server Roles:*** None.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that made a change to Global Object Access Auditing policy. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that made a change to Global Object Access Auditing policy.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Object:**

-   **Object Server** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: has “**LSA**” value for this event.

-   **Object Type** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: The type of an object to which this event applies. Always “**Global SACL**” for this event.

    The following table contains the list of the most common **Object Types**:

| Directory               | Event        | Timer                | Device                  |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Mutant                  | Type         | File                 | Token                   |
| Thread                  | Section      | WindowStation        | DebugObject             |
| FilterCommunicationPort | EventPair    | Driver               | IoCompletion            |
| Controller              | SymbolicLink | WmiGuid              | Process                 |
| Profile                 | Desktop      | KeyedEvent           | Central Access Policies |
| Key                     | WaitablePort | Callback             | Global SACL             |
| Job                     | Port         | FilterConnectionPort |                         |
| ALPC Port               | Semaphore    | Adapter              |                         |

-   **Object Name: **

    -   Key – if “Registry” Global Object Access Auditing policy was changed.

    -   File – if “File system” Global Object Access Auditing policy was changed.

**Auditing Settings:**

-   **Original Security Descriptor** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the old Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) value for the Global Object Access Auditing policy. Empty if Global Object Access Auditing policy SACL was not set.

-   **New Security Descriptor** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the new Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) value for the Global Object Access Auditing policy.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;The ** Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)** defines string elements for enumerating information contained in the security descriptor.

> Example:

> *O*:BA*G*:SY*D*:(D;;0xf0007;;;AN)(D;;0xf0007;;;BG)(A;;0xf0007;;;SY)(A;;0×7;;;BA)*S*:ARAI(AU;SAFA;DCLCRPCRSDWDWO;;;WD)

> - *O*: = Owner. SID of specific security principal, or reserved (pre-defined) value, for example: BA (BUILTIN\_ADMINISTRATORS), WD (Everyone), SY (LOCAL\_SYSTEM), etc.

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 4817(S): Auditing settings on object were changed.

-   If you use Global Object Access Auditing policies, then this event should be always monitored, especially on high value assets or computers. If this change was not planned, investigate the reason for the change.

-   If you don’t use Global Object Access Auditing policies, then this event should be always monitored because it indicates use of Global Object Access Auditing policies outside of your standard procedures.
