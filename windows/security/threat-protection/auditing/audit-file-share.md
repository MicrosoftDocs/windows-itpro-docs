# Audit File Share


Audit File Share allows you to audit events related to file shares: creation, deletion, modification, and access attempts. Also, it shows failed SMB SPN checks.

There are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shares; therefore, after this setting is enabled, access to all shares on the system will be audited.

Combined with File System auditing, File Share auditing enables you to track what content was accessed, the source (IP address and port) of the request, and the user account that was used for the access.

**Event volume**:

-   High on file servers.

-   High on domain controllers because of SYSVOL network access required by Group Policy.

-   Low on member servers and workstations.
