# Audit Removable Storage


Audit Removable Storage allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a removable storage device. A security audit event is generated for all objects and all types of access requested, with no dependency on objectâ€™s [SACL](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists).

At the same time, you will be able to track which files were written or executed from a removable storage device.<br>You can track, for example, actions with files or folders on USB flash drives or sticks that were inserted into domain controllers or high value servers, which is typically not allowed. <br>We recommend Failure auditing to track failed access attempts. |
