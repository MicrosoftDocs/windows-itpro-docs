# Audit Filtering Platform Connection


Audit Filtering Platform Connection determines whether the operating system generates audit events when connections are allowed or blocked by the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page).

Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to filter and modify TCP/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security (IPsec)-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls (RPCs).

This subcategory contains Windows Filtering Platform events about blocked and allowed connections, blocked and allowed port bindings, blocked and allowed port listening actions, and blocked to accept incoming connections applications.

**Event volume**: High.
