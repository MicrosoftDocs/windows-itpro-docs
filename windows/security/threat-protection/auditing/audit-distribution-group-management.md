# Audit Distribution Group Management


Audit Distribution Group Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events for specific distribution-group management tasks.

This subcategory generates events only on domain controllers.

**Event volume**: Low on domain controllers.

This subcategory allows you to audit events generated by changes to distribution groups such as the following:

- Distribution group is created, changed, or deleted.

- Member is added or removed from a distribution group.

If you need to monitor for group type changes, you need to monitor for “[4764](event-4764.md): A group’s type was changed.” “Audit Security Group Management” subcategory success auditing must be enabled.

| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Domain Controller | IF              | No              | IF               | No               | IF - Typically, actions related to distribution groups have low security relevance. It is much more important to monitor Security Group changes. However, if you want to monitor for critical distribution groups changes, such as if a member was added to internal critical distribution group (executives, administrative group, for example), you need to enable this subcategory for Success auditing.<br>Typically, volume of these events is low on domain controllers.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |

- 4762(S): A member was removed from a security-disabled universal group. See event _[4752](event-4752.md): A member was removed from a security-disabled global group._ Event 4762 is the same, except  it is generated for a **universal** distribution group instead of a **global** distribution group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations are the same. The type of group is the only difference.

- 4763(S): A security-disabled universal group was deleted. See event _[4753](event-4753.md): A security-disabled global group was deleted._ Event 4763 is the same, except it is generated for a **universal** distribution group instead of a **global** distribution group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations are the same. The type of group is the only difference.

- 4744(S): A security-disabled local group was created. See event _[4749](event-4749.md): A security-disabled global group was created._ Event 4744 is the same, except it is generated for a **local** distribution group instead of a **global** distribution group. All event fields, XML, and recommendations are the same. The type of group is the only difference.

- 4745(S): A security-disabled local group was changed. See event _[4750](event-4750.md): A security-disabled global group was changed._ Event 4745 is the same, except it is generated for a **local** distribution group instead of a **global** distribution group.

- 4746(S): A member was added to a security-disabled local group.
