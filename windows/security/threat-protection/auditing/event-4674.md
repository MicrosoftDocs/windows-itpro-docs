***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that requested privileged operation. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that requested privileged operation.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Object**:

-   **Object Server** \[Type = UnicodeString\] \[Optional\]: Contains the name of the Windows subsystem calling the routine. Subsystems examples are:

    -   Security

    -   Security Account Manager

    -   NT Local Security Authority / Authentication Service

    -   SC Manager

    -   Win32 SystemShutdown module

    -   LSA

-   **Object Type** \[Type = UnicodeString\] \[Optional\]: The type of an object that was accessed during the operation.

    The following table contains the list of the most common **Object Types**:

| Directory               | Event        | Timer                | Device             |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Mutant                  | Type         | File                 | Token              |
| Thread                  | Section      | WindowStation        | DebugObject        |
| FilterCommunicationPort | EventPair    | Driver               | IoCompletion       |
| Controller              | SymbolicLink | WmiGuid              | Process            |
| Profile                 | Desktop      | KeyedEvent           | SC\_MANAGER OBJECT |
| Key                     | WaitablePort | Callback             |                    |
| Job                     | Port         | FilterConnectionPort |                    |
| ALPC Port               | Semaphore    | Adapter              |                    |

-   **Object Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\] \[Optional\]: the name of the object that was accessed during the operation.

-   **Object Handle** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal value of a handle to **Object Name**. This field can help you correlate this event with other events that might contain the same Handle ID, for example, “4656: A handle to an object was requested” event in appropriate/other subcategory. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “0x0”.

**Process Information:**

-   **Process ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process that attempted the operation on the privileged object. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):

    <img src="images/task-manager.png" alt="Task manager illustration" width="585" height="375" />

    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.

    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\New Process ID**.

-   **Process Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.

**Requested Operation**:

-   **Desired Access** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: The desired access mask. This mask depends on **Object Server** and **Object Type** parameters values. The value of this parameter is in decimal format. There is no detailed information about this parameter in this document. If **Desired Access** is not presented, then this parameter will have “**0**” value.

-   **Privileges** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of user privileges which were requested. The possible privileges depend on the subcategory, either **Audit Non Sensitive Privilege Use** or **Audit Sensitive Privilege Use**, as shown in the following two tables:

|     **Subcategory of event**      |                        **Privilege Name: <br>User Right Group Policy Name**                         |                                                                                                                                                                                           **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 4674(S, F): An operation was attempted on a privileged object.

> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).

-   Monitor for this event where “**Subject\\Security ID**” is *not* one of these well-known security principals: LOCAL SYSTEM, NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, and where “**Subject\\Security ID**” is not an administrative account that is expected to have the listed **Privileges**. Especially monitor Failure events.

<!-- -->

-   If you need to monitor events related to specific Windows subsystems (“**Object Server**”), for example **LSA** or **Security Account Manager**, monitor this event for the corresponding “**Object Server**.”

-   <span id="Reccomendations_Object_Type" class="anchor"></span>If you need to monitor events related to specific Windows object types (“**Object Type**”), for example **File** or **Key**, monitor this event for the corresponding “**Object Type**.”

-   If you have a pre-defined “**Process Name**” for the process reported in this event, monitor all events with “**Process Name**” not equal to your defined value.

-   You can monitor to see if “**Process Name**” is not in a standard folder (for example, not in **System32** or **Program Files**) or is in a restricted folder (for example, **Temporary Internet Files**).

<!-- -->

-   If you have a pre-defined list of restricted substrings or words in process names (for example, “**mimikatz**” or “**cain.exe**”), check for these substrings in “**Process Name**.”

<!-- -->

-   If you know that specific “**Subject\\Security ID**” should only be able to use the privileges in a pre-defined list, monitor for events in which “**Subject\\Security ID**” used “**Privileges**” that are not on that list.

<!-- -->

-   If you have a list of specific user rights which should never be used, or used only by a few accounts (for example, SeDebugPrivilege), trigger an alert for those “**Privileges**.”

-   If you have a list of specific user rights for which every use must be reported or monitored (for example, SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege), trigger an alert for those “**Privileges**.”
