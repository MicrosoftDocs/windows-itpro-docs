# Audit Handle Manipulation


Audit Handle Manipulation enables generation of “4658: The handle to an object was closed” in [Audit File System](audit-file-system.md), [Audit Kernel Object](audit-kernel-object.md), [Audit Registry](audit-registry.md), [Audit Removable Storage](audit-removable-storage.md) and [Audit SAM](audit-sam.md) subcategories, and shows object’s handle duplication and close actions.

**Event volume**: High.

| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Domain Controller | No              | No              | No               | No               | Typically, information about the duplication or closing of an object handle has little to no security relevance and is hard to parse or analyze.<br>There is no recommendation to enable this subcategory for Success or Failure auditing, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor in Object’s Handles level. |
| Member Server     | No              | No              | No               | No               | Typically, information about the duplication or closing of an object handle has little to no security relevance and is hard to parse or analyze.<br>There is no recommendation to enable this subcategory for Success or Failure auditing, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor in Object’s Handles level. |
| Workstation       | No              | No              | No               | No               | Typically, information about the duplication or closing of an object handle has little to no security relevance and is hard to parse or analyze.<br>There is no recommendation to enable this subcategory for Success or Failure auditing, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor in Object’s Handles level. |
