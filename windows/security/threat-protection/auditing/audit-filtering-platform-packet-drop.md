# Audit Filtering Platform Packet Drop


Audit Filtering Platform Packet Drop determines whether the operating system generates audit events when packets are dropped by the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page).

Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to filter and modify TCP/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security (IPsec)-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls (RPCs).

A high rate of dropped packets *may* indicate that there have been attempts to gain unauthorized access to computers on your network.

**Event volume**: High.

**Events List:**

-   [5152](event-5152.md)(F): The Windows Filtering Platform blocked a packet.

-   [5153](event-5153.md)(S): A more restrictive Windows Filtering Platform filter has blocked a packet.
