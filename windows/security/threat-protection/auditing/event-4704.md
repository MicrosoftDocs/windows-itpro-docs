***Required Server Roles:*** None.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that made a change to local user right policy. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that made a change to local user right policy.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Target Account:**

-   **Account Name** \[Type = SID\]: the SID of security principal for which user rights were assigned. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

**New Right:**

-   **User Right** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of assigned user rights. This event generates only for *user* rights, not logon rights. Here is the list of possible user rights:

| Privilege Name                  | User Right Group Policy Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| SeBackupPrivilege               | Back up files and directories                                  | -   Required to perform backup operations. <br>With this privilege, the user can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system.<br>This privilege causes the system to grant all read access control to any file, regardless of the [*access control list*](/windows/win32/secgloss/a-gly#_security_access_control_list_gly) (ACL) specified for the file. Any access request other than read is still evaluated with the ACL. The following access rights are granted if this privilege is held:<br>READ\_CONTROL<br>ACCESS\_SYSTEM\_SECURITY<br>FILE\_GENERIC\_READ<br>FILE\_TRAVERSE                                                                                                                |

| **Actions typically performed by the SYSTEM account**: This event and certain other events should be monitored to see if they are triggered by any account other than SYSTEM.                                                                                                                                     | Because this event is typically triggered by the SYSTEM account, we recommend that you report it whenever **“Subject\\Security ID”** is not SYSTEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **High-value accounts**: You might have high-value domain or local accounts for which you need to monitor each action.<br>Examples of high-value accounts are database administrators, built-in local administrator account, domain administrators, service accounts, domain controller accounts and so on. | Monitor this event with the **“Subject\\Security ID”** that corresponds to the high-value account or accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Anomalies or malicious actions**: You might have specific requirements for detecting anomalies or monitoring potential malicious actions. For example, you might need to monitor for use of an account outside of working hours.                                                                                | When you monitor for anomalies or malicious actions, use the **“Subject\\Security ID”** (with other information) to monitor how or when a particular account is being used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Non-active accounts**: You might have non-active, disabled, or guest accounts, or other accounts that should never be used.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Monitor this event with the **“Subject\\Security ID”** or “**Target Account\\ Account Name**” that correspond to the accounts that should never be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Account allowlist**: You might have a specific allowlist of accounts that are the only ones allowed to perform actions corresponding to particular events.                                                                                                                                                      | If this event corresponds to an “allowlist-only” action, review the **“Subject\\Security ID”** for accounts that are outside the allowlist. Also check the “**Target Account\\Account Name**” and **“New Right”** to see what was enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Accounts of different types**: You might want to ensure that certain actions are performed only by certain account types, for example, local or domain account, machine or user account, vendor or employee account, and so on.                                                                                 | If this event corresponds to an action you want to monitor for certain account types, review the **“Subject\\Security ID”** to see whether the account type is as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **External accounts**: You might be monitoring accounts from another domain, or “external” accounts that are not allowed to perform certain actions (represented by certain specific events).                                                                                                                     | Monitor this event for the **“Subject\\Account Domain”** corresponding to accounts from another domain or “external” accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Restricted-use computers or devices**: You might have certain computers, machines, or devices on which certain people (accounts) should perform only limited actions, or no actions at all.                                                                                                                     | Monitor the target **Computer:** (or other target device) for actions performed by the **“Subject\\Security ID”** that you are concerned about. <br>Also check **“Target Account\\ Account Name”** to see whether the change in rights should be made on that computer for that account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **User rights that should be restricted or monitored**: You might have a list of user rights that you want to restrict or monitor.                                                                                                                                                                                | Monitor this event and compare the “**New Right\\User Right**” to your list of user rights, to see whether the right should be assigned to **“Target Account\\Account Name**.” Trigger an alert for user rights that should not be enabled, especially on high-value servers or other computers.<br>For example, your list of restricted rights might say that only administrative accounts should have **SeAuditPrivilege**. As another example, your list might say that no accounts should have **SeTcbPrivilege** or **SeDebugPrivilege**. |
| **Account naming conventions**: Your organization might have specific naming conventions for account names.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Monitor “**Subject\\Account Name”** for names that don’t comply with naming conventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
