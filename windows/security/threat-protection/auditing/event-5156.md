***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Application Information**:

-   **Process ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process that received the connection. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):

    <img src="images/task-manager.png" alt="Task manager illustration" width="585" height="375" />

    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.

    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\New Process ID**.

-   **Application Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.

    Logical disk is displayed in format \\device\\harddiskvolume\#. You can get all local volume numbers by using **diskpart** utility. The command to get volume numbers using diskpart is “**list volume”**:

    -   IPv4 Address

    -   IPv6 Address

    -   :: - all IP addresses in IPv6 format

    -   0.0.0.0 - all IP addresses in IPv4 format

    -   127.0.0.1, ::1 - localhost

-   **Source Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** port number from which the connection was initiated.

-   **Destination Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** IP address where the connection was received.

    -   IPv4 Address

    -   IPv6 Address

    -   :: - all IP addresses in IPv6 format

    -   0.0.0.0 - all IP addresses in IPv4 format

    -   127.0.0.1, ::1 - localhost

-   **Destination Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** port number where the connection was received.

-   **Protocol** \[Type = UInt32\]: number of the protocol that was used.

**Filter Information:**

-   **Filter Run-Time ID** \[Type = UInt64\]: unique filter ID that allowed the connection.

    To find a specific Windows Filtering Platform filter by ID, run the following command: **netsh wfp show filters**. As a result of this command, the **filters.xml** file will be generated. Open this file and find specific substring with required filter ID (**&lt;filterId&gt;**)**,** for example:

<img src="images/filters-xml-file.png" alt="Filters.xml file illustration" width="840" height="176" />

-   **Layer Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: [Application Layer Enforcement](/windows/win32/fwp/application-layer-enforcement--ale-) layer name.

-   **Layer Run-Time ID** \[Type = UInt64\]: Windows Filtering Platform layer identifier. To find a specific Windows Filtering Platform layer ID, run the following command: **netsh wfp show state**. As a result of this command, the **wfpstate.xml** file will be generated. Open this file and find specific substring with required layer ID (**&lt;layerId&gt;**)**,** for example:

<img src="images/wfpstate-xml.png" alt="Wfpstate xml illustration" width="1563" height="780" />

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 5156(S): The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted a connection.

-   If you have a predefined application that should be used to perform the operation that was reported by this event, monitor events with “**Application**” not equal to your defined application.

-   You can monitor to see if “**Application**” isn't in a standard folder (for example, not in **System32** or **Program Files**) or is in a restricted folder (for example, **Temporary Internet Files**).

-   If you have a pre-defined list of restricted substrings or words in application names (for example, “**mimikatz**” or “**cain.exe**”), check for these substrings in “**Application**.”

-   Check that “**Source Address”** is one of the addresses assigned to the computer.

-   If the computer or device shouldn't have access to the Internet, or contains only applications that don’t connect to the Internet, monitor for [5156](event-5156.md) events where “**Destination Address”** is an IP address from the Internet (not from private IP ranges).

-   If you know that the computer should never contact or should never be contacted by certain network IP addresses, monitor for these addresses in “**Destination Address**.**”**

-   If you've an allowlist of IP addresses that the computer or device is expected to contact or to be contacted by, monitor for IP addresses in “**Destination Address”** that aren't in the allowlist.

-   If you need to monitor all inbound connections to a specific local port, monitor for [5156](event-5156.md) events with that “**Source Port**.**”**

-   Monitor for all connections with a “**Protocol Number”** that isn't typical for this device or computer, for example, anything other than 1, 6, or 17.

-   If the computer’s communication with “**Destination Address”** should always use a specific “**Destination Port**,**”** monitor for any other “**Destination Port**.”
