***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** User Principal Name (UPN) or another type of account identifier for which 802.1x authentication request was made.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;[User principal name](/windows/win32/secauthn/user-name-formats) (UPN) format is used to specify an Internet-style name, such as UserName@Example.Microsoft.com.

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account for which 802.1x authentication request was made.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following ones:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Network Information:**

-   **Name (SSID)** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** SSID of the wireless network to which authentication request was sent.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **service set identifier (SSID)** is a sequence of characters that uniquely names a wireless local area network (WLAN). An SSID is sometimes referred to as a "network name." This name allows stations to connect to the desired network when multiple independent networks operate in the same physical area.

-   **Interface GUID** \[Type = GUID\]**:** GUID of the network interface which was used for authentication request.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**GUID** is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier'. It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources, activities or instances.

You can see interface’s GUID using the following commands:

-   “netsh lan show interfaces” – for wired interfaces.

-   “netsh wlan show interfaces” – for wireless interfaces.

-   **Local MAC Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** local interface’s MAC-address.

-   **Peer MAC Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** peer’s (typically – access point) MAC-address.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Reason Code** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** contains Reason Text (explanation of Reason Code) and Reason Code for wireless authentication results. See more information about reason codes for wireless authentication here: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd877212(v=vs.85).aspx>, <https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc727747(v=ws.10).aspx>.

-   **Error Code** \[Type = HexInt32\]**:** there's no information about this field in this document.

-   **EAP Reason Code** \[Type = HexInt32\]**:** there's no information about this field in this document. See [EAP Related Error and Information Constants](/windows/win32/eaphost/eap-related-error-and-information-constants) for additional information.

-   **EAP Root Cause String** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** there's no information about this field in this document.

-   **EAP Error Code** \[Type = HexInt32\]**:** there's no information about this field in this document.
