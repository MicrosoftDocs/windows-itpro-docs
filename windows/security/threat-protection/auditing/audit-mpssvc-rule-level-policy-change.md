# Audit MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change


Audit MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change determines whether the operating system generates audit events when changes are made to policy rules for the Microsoft Protection Service (MPSSVC.exe).

The Microsoft Protection Service, which is used by Windows Firewall, is an integral part of the computerâ€™s threat protection against malware. The tracked activities include:

-   Active policies when the Windows Firewall service starts.

-   Changes to Windows Firewall rules.

-   Changes to the Windows Firewall exception list.

-   Changes to Windows Firewall settings.

-   Rules ignored or not applied by the Windows Firewall service.

-   Changes to Windows Firewall Group Policy settings.

Changes to firewall rules are important for understanding the security state of the computer and how well it is protected against network attacks.
