***Field Descriptions:***

**Change Type** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the type of change which was made. The format is “**policy\_name** modified”. These are some possible values of **policy\_name**:

| Value           | Group Policy Name \\ Description                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lockout Policy  | Computer’s “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Account Lockout Policy” settings were modified.                                                      |
| Password Policy | Computer's “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy” settings were modified.                                                             |
| Logoff Policy   | "[Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/jj852195(v=ws.11))" group policy setting was changed. |
| -               | Machine Account Quota ([ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd391926(v=ws.10))) domain attribute was modified.  |

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that made a change to specific local policy. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that made a change to specific local policy.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Domain:**

-   **Domain Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of domain for which policy changes were made.

<!-- -->

-   **Domain ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** the SID of domain for which policy changes were made. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

**Changed Attributes:** For attributes which were not changed the value will be “**-**“.

-   **Min. Password Age** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Minimum password age” group policy. Numeric value.

<!-- -->

-   **Max. Password Age** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Maximum password age” group policy. Numeric value.

-   **Force Logoff** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: “\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire” group policy.

-   **Lockout Threshold** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Account Lockout Policy\\Account lockout threshold” group policy. Numeric value.

-   **Lockout Observation Window** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Account Lockout Policy\\Reset account lockout counter after” group policy. Numeric value.

-   **Lockout Duration** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: “\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Account Lockout Policy\\Account lockout duration” group policy. Numeric value.

-   **Password Properties** \[Type = UnicodeString\]:

| Value | Group Policy settings                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

-   **Mixed Domain Mode** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: there is no information about this field in this document.

-   **Domain Behavior Version** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: [msDS-Behavior-Version](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/d7422d35-448a-451a-8846-6a7def0044df) domain attribute was modified. Numeric value. Possible values:

| SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege        | Take ownership of files or other objects                       | Required to take ownership of an object without being granted discretionary access. This privilege allows the owner value to be set only to those values that the holder may legitimately assign as the owner of an object.<br>With this privilege, the user can take ownership of any securable object in the system, including Active Directory objects, files and folders, printers, registry keys, processes, and threads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 4739(S): Domain Policy was changed.

-   Any settings changes to “**Account Lockout Policy**”, “**Password Policy**”, or “**Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire**”, plus any **domain functional level and attributes** changes that are reported by this event, must be monitored and an alert should be triggered. If this change was not planned, investigate the reason for the change.
