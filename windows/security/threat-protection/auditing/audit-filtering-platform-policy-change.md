# Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change


Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change allows you to audit events generated by changes to the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page) (WFP), such as the following:

- IPsec services status.

- Changes to IPsec policy settings.

- Changes to Windows Filtering Platform Base Filtering Engine policy settings.

- Changes to WFP providers and engine.

Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to filter and modify TCP/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security (IPsec)-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls (RPCs).
