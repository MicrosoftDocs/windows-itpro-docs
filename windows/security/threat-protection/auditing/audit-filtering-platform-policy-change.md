# Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016

Audit Filtering Platform Policy Change allows you to audit events generated by changes to the [Windows Filtering Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx) (WFP), such as the following:

- IPsec services status.

- Changes to IPsec policy settings.

- Changes to Windows Filtering Platform Base Filtering Engine policy settings.

- Changes to WFP providers and engine.

Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to filter and modify TCP/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security (IPsec)-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls (RPCs).
