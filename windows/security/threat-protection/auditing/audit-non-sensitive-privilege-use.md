# Audit Non-Sensitive Privilege Use


Audit Non-Sensitive Privilege Use contains events that show usage of non-sensitive privileges. This is the list of non-sensitive privileges:

-   Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller

-   Add workstations to domain

-   Adjust memory quotas for a process

-   Bypass traverse checking

-   Change the system time

-   Change the time zone

-   Create a page file

-   Create global objects

-   Create permanent shared objects

-   Create symbolic links

-   Force shutdown from a remote system

-   Increase a process working set

-   Increase scheduling priority

-   Lock pages in memory

-   Modify an object label

-   Perform volume maintenance tasks

-   Profile single process

-   Profile system performance

-   Remove computer from docking station

-   Shut down the system

-   Synchronize directory service data

This subcategory also contains informational events from filesystem Transaction Manager.

If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a non-sensitive privilege is called. Success audits record successful attempts, and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.

**Event volume**: Very High.
