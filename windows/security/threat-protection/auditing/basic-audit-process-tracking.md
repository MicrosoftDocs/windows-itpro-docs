# Audit process tracking


Determines whether to audit detailed tracking information for events such as program activation, process exit, handle duplication, and indirect object access.

If you define this policy setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, audit failures, or not audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when the process being tracked succeeds. Failure audits generate an audit entry when the process being tracked fails.

To set this value to **No auditing**, in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the Define these policy settings check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.

**Default:** No auditing.

## Configure this security setting

You can configure this security setting under Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Audit Policy.
