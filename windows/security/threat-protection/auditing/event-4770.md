***Required Server Roles:*** Active Directory domain controller.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Account Information:**

- **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the User Principal Name (UPN) of the account that requested ticket renewal. Computer account name ends with **$** character in UPN. This field typically has the following value format: user\_account\_name@FULL\_DOMAIN\_NAME.

  - User account example: dadmin@CONTOSO.LOCAL

  - Computer account example: WIN81$@CONTOSO.LOCAL

    This parameter in this event is optional and can be empty in some cases.

- **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the Kerberos Realm that **Account Name** belongs to. This can appear in a variety of formats, including the following:

  -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

  -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

  -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

      This parameter in this event is optional and can be empty in some cases.

**Service Information:**

-   **Service Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the name of the account or computer for which the TGS ticket was renewed.

    -   This parameter in this event is optional and can be empty in some cases.

-   **Service ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of the account or computer object for which the TGS ticket was renewed. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

**Network Information:**

-   **Client Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** IP address of the computer from which the TGS renewal request was received. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   **IPv6** or **IPv4** address.

    -   **::ffff:IPv4\_address**.

    -   **::1** - localhost.

-   **Client Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: source port number of client network connection (TGS renewal request connection).

    -   0 for local (localhost) requests.

**Additional information:**

-   **Ticket Options**: \[Type = HexInt32\]: this is a set of different Ticket Flags in hexadecimal format.

    Example:

    -   Ticket Options: 0x40810010

    -   Binary view: 01000000100000010000000000010000

    -   Using **MSB 0** bit numbering we have bit 1, 8, 15 and 27 set = Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table below **“MSB 0”** bit numbering is used, because RFC documents use this style. In “MSB 0” style bit numbering begins from left.<br><img src="images/msb.png" alt="MSB illustration" width="224" height="57" />

The most common values:

-   0x40810010 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

-   0x40810000 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize

-   0x60810010 - Forwardable, Forwarded, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

Tickets issued without the performance of this check will be noted by the reset (0) value of the TRANSITED-POLICY-CHECKED flag, indicating to the application server that the transited field must be checked locally.
