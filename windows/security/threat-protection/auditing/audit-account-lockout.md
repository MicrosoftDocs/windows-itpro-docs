# Audit Account Lockout

Audit Account Lockout enables you to audit security events that are generated by a failed attempt to log on to an account that is locked out.

If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an account cannot log on to a computer because the account is locked out. 

Account lockout events are essential for understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.

**Event volume**: Low.

This subcategory failure logon attempts, when account was already locked out.
