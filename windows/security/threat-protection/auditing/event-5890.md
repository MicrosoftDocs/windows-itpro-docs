***Event Description:***

This event generates when new object was added to the [COM+ Catalog](/windows/win32/cossdk/the-com--catalog).

For some reason this event belongs to [Audit System Integrity](event-5890.md) subcategory, but generation of this event enables in this subcategory.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that requested the “add object” operation. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “add object” operation.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Object**:

-   **COM+ Catalog Collection** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the name of COM+ collection to which the new object was added. Here is the list of possible collection values with descriptions:

-   **Object Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: object-specific fields with the names and identifiers for the new object. It depends on **COM+ Catalog Collection** value, for example, if **COM+ Catalog Collection** = [Applications](/windows/win32/cossdk/applications), then you can find that:

    -   **ID** - A GUID representing the application. This property is returned when the [Key](/windows/win32/api/comadmin/nf-comadmin-icatalogobject-get_key) property method is called on an object of this collection.

    -   **AppPartitionID** - A GUID representing the application partition ID.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**GUID** is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier'. It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources, activities or instances.

-   **Object Details** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the list of new object’s (**Object Name**) properties.

    The items have the following format: Property\_Name = VALUE

    Check description for specific **COM+ Catalog Collection** to see the list of object’s properties and descriptions.

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 5890(S): An object was added to the COM+ Catalog.

> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).

-   If you need to monitor for creation of new COM+ objects within specific COM+ collection, monitor all [5890](event-5890.md) events with the corresponding **COM+ Catalog Collection** field value.
