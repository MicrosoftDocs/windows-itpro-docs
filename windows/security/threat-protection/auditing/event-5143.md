***Field Descriptions:***

**Subject:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account that requested the “modify network share object” operation. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID can't be resolved, you'll see the source data in the event.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “modify network share object” operation.

-   **Account Domain** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following ones:

    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO

    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local

    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL

    -   For some [well-known security principals](/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.

    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.

-   **Logon ID** \[Type = HexInt64\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”

**Share Information:**

-   **Object Type** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: The type of an object that was modified. Always “**Directory**” for this event.

    The following table contains the list of the most common **Object Types**:

| Directory               | Event        | Timer                | Device       |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|

| FilterCommunicationPort | EventPair    | Driver               | IoCompletion |
| Controller              | SymbolicLink | WmiGuid              | Process      |
| Profile                 | Desktop      | KeyedEvent           | Adapter      |
| Key                     | WaitablePort | Callback             | Semaphore    |
| Job                     | Port         | FilterConnectionPort | ALPC Port    |

-   **Share Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of the modified share object. The format is: \\\\\*\\SHARE\_NAME

-   **Share Path** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the full system (NTFS) path for the added share object. The format is: \\\\??\\PATH. Can be empty, for example for **Share Name**: \\\\\*\\IPC$.

-   **Old Remark** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the old value of network share “**Comments:**” field. Has “**N/A**” value if it isn't set.

-   **New Remark** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the new value of network share “**Comments:**” field. Has “**N/A**” value if it isn't set.

-   **Old MaxUsers** \[Type = HexInt32\]: old hexadecimal value of “**Limit the number of simultaneous user to:**” field. Has “**0xFFFFFFFF**” value if the number of connections is unlimited.

-   **New Maxusers** \[Type = HexInt32\]**:** new hexadecimal value of “**Limit the number of simultaneous user to:**” field. Has “**0xFFFFFFFF**” value if the number of connections is unlimited.

-   **Old ShareFlags** \[Type = HexInt32\]: old hexadecimal value of “**Offline Settings**” caching settings window flags.

<img src="images/offline-settings.png" alt="Offline Settings illustration" width="395" height="354" />

-   **New ShareFlags** \[Type = HexInt32\]: new hexadecimal value of “**Offline Settings**” caching settings window flags.

-   **Old SD** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the old Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) value for network share security descriptor.

-   **New SD** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the new Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) value for network share security descriptor.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;The **Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)** defines string elements for enumerating information contained in the security descriptor.

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 5143(S): A network share object was modified.

> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).

- If you have high-value computers for which you need to monitor all modifications to all shares or specific shares (“**Share Name**”), monitor this event<b>.</b> For example, you could monitor all changes to the SYSVOL share on domain controllers.
