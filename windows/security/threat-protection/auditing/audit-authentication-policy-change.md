# Audit Authentication Policy Change

Audit Authentication Policy Change determines whether the operating system generates audit events when changes are made to authentication policy.

Changes made to authentication policy include:

-   Creation, modification, and removal of forest and domain trusts.

-   Changes to Kerberos policy under Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Kerberos Policy.

-   When any of the following user logon rights is granted to a user or group:

    -   Access this computer from the network

    -   Allow logon locally

    -   Allow logon through Remote Desktop

    -   Logon as a batch job

    -   Logon as a service

-   Namespace collision, such as when an added trust collides with an existing namespace name.

This setting is useful for tracking changes in domain-level and forest-level trust and privileges that are granted to user accounts or groups.

**Event volume**: Low.
