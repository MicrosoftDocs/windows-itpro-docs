# Audit Process Termination


Audit Process Termination determines whether the operating system generates audit events when process has exited.

Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.

This policy setting can help you track user activity and understand how the computer is used.

**Event volume**: Low to Medium, depending on system usage.
