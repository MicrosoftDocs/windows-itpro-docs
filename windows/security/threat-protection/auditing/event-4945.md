## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 4945(S): A rule was listed when the Windows Firewall started.

-   Typically this event has an informational purpose.

-   Unfortunately this event shows rules only for **Public** profile, but you still can compare this list with your organization's Windows Firewall baseline for Public profile rules on different computers, and trigger an alert if the configuration isn't the same.
