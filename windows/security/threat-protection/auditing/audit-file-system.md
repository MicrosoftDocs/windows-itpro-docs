# Audit File System


> [!NOTE]
> For more details about applicability on older operating system versions, read the article [Audit File System](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn319068(v=ws.11)).

Audit File System determines whether the operating system generates audit events when users attempt to access file system objects.

Audit events are generated only for objects that have configured system access control lists ([SACL](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists)s), and only if the type of access requested (such as Write, Read, or Modify) and the account making the request match the settings in the [SACL](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists).

If success auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any account successfully accesses a file system object that has a matching SACL. If failure auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any user unsuccessfully attempts to access a file system object that has a matching SACL.

These events are essential for tracking activity for file objects that are sensitive or valuable and require extra monitoring.

**Event volume**: Varies, depending on how file system [SACL](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists)s are configured.

No audit events are generated for the default file system [SACL](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists)s.

This subcategory allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects, file system object deletion and permissions change operations and hard link creation actions.

Only one event, “[4658](event-4658.md): The handle to an object was closed,” depends on the [Audit Handle Manipulation](audit-handle-manipulation.md) subcategory (Success auditing must be enabled). All other events generate without any additional configuration.

Do not enable this subcategory if you have not planned how to use and analyze the collected information. It is also important to delete non-effective, excess [SACL](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists)s. Otherwise the auditing log will be overloaded with useless information.<br>Failure events can show you unsuccessful attempts to access specific file system objects.<br>Consider enabling this subcategory for critical computers first, after you develop a File System Security Monitoring policy for them. |
