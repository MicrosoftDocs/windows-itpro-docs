# Audit Detailed Directory Service Replication


Audit Detailed Directory Service Replication determines whether the operating system generates audit events that contain detailed tracking information about data that is replicated between domain controllers.

This audit subcategory can be useful to diagnose replication issues.

**Event volume**: These events can create a very high volume of event data on domain controllers.
