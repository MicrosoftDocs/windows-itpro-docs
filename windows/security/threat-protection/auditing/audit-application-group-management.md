# Audit Application Group Management

Audit Application Group Management generates events for actions related to [application groups](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc771579(v=ws.11)), such as group creation, modification, addition or removal of group member and some other actions.

[Application groups](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc771579(v=ws.11)) are used by [Authorization Manager](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc726036(v=ws.11)).

Audit Application Group Management subcategory is out of scope of this document, because [Authorization Manager](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc726036(v=ws.11)) is very rarely in use and it is deprecated starting from Windows Server 2012.
