***Event Description:***

This event generates every time [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page) permits an application or service to listen on a port.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.

***Required Server Roles:*** None.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Application Information**:

-   **Process ID** \[Type = Pointer\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process that was permitted to listen on the port. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):

    <img src="images/task-manager.png" alt="Task manager illustration" width="585" height="375" />

    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.

    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\New Process ID**.

-   **Application Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.

    Logical disk is displayed in format \\device\\harddiskvolume\#. You can get all local volume numbers by using **diskpart** utility. The command to get volume numbers using diskpart is “**list volume”**:

**Network Information:**

-   **Source Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** local IP address on which application requested to listen on the port.

    -   IPv4 Address

    -   IPv6 Address

    -   :: - all IP addresses in IPv6 format
s
    -   0.0.0.0 - all IP addresses in IPv4 format

    -   127.0.0.1, ::1 - localhost

-   **Source Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: source TCP\\UDP port number that was requested for listening by application.

-   **Protocol** \[Type = UInt32\]: protocol number. For example:

    -   6 – TCP.

    -   17 – UDP.

        More information about possible values for this field: <https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc959827.aspx>.

**Filter Information:**

-   **Filter Run-Time ID** \[Type = UInt64\]: unique filter ID that allows application to listen on the specific port. By default Windows firewall won't prevent a port from being listened by an application and if this application doesn’t match any filters you'll get value **0** in this field.

    To find a specific Windows Filtering Platform filter by ID, run the following command: **netsh wfp show filters**. As a result of this command, the **filters.xml** file will be generated. Open this file and find specific substring with required filter ID (**&lt;filterId&gt;**)**,** for example:

<img src="images/filters-xml-file.png" alt="Filters.xml file illustration" width="840" height="176" />

-   **Layer Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: [Application Layer Enforcement](/windows/win32/fwp/application-layer-enforcement--ale-) layer name.

-   **Layer Run-Time ID** \[Type = UInt64\]: Windows Filtering Platform layer identifier. To find a specific Windows Filtering Platform layer ID, run the following command: **netsh wfp show state**. As a result of this command, the **wfpstate.xml** file will be generated. Open this file and find specific substring with required layer ID (**&lt;layerId&gt;**)**,** for example:

<img src="images/wfpstate-xml.png" alt="Wfpstate xml illustration" width="1563" height="780" />

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 5154(S): The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted an application or service to listen on a port for incoming connections.

-   If you've an “allowlist” of applications that are associated with certain operating systems or server roles, and that are expected to listen on specific ports, monitor this event for **“Application Name”** and other relevant information.

-   If a certain application is allowed to listen only on specific port numbers, monitor this event for **“Application Name”** and **“Network Information\\Source Port**.**”**

-   If a certain application is allowed to listen only on a specific IP address, monitor this event for **“Application Name”** and **“Network Information\\Source Address**.**”**

-   If a certain application is allowed to use only TCP or UDP protocols, monitor this event for **“Application Name”** and the protocol number in **“Network Information\\Protocol**.**”**

-   If you have a predefined application that should be used to perform the operation that was reported by this event, monitor events with “**Application**” not equal to your defined application.

-   You can monitor to see if “**Application**” isn't in a standard folder (for example, not in **System32** or **Program Files**) or is in a restricted folder (for example, **Temporary Internet Files**).

-   If you have a pre-defined list of restricted substrings or words in application names (for example, “**mimikatz**” or “**cain.exe**”), check for these substrings in “**Application**.”

-   Typically this event has an informational purpose.
