# 6410(F): Code integrity determined that a file does not meet the security requirements to load into a process.


[Code Integrity](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd348642(v=ws.10)) is a feature that improves the security of the operating system by validating the integrity of a driver or system file each time it's loaded into memory. Code Integrity detects whether an unsigned driver or system file is being loaded into the kernel, or whether a system file has been modified by malicious software that is being run by a user account with administrative permissions. On x64-based versions of the operating system, kernel-mode drivers must be digitally signed.

This event generates due to writable [shared sections](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/cc307397(v=msdn.10)) being present in a file image.

There's no example of this event in this document.
