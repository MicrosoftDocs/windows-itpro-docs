# Audit system events


Determines whether to audit when a user restarts or shuts down the computer or when an event occurs that affects either the system security or the security log.

If you define this policy setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, audit failures, or not audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when a logon attempt succeeds. Failure audits generate an audit entry when a logon attempt fails.

To set this value to **No auditing**, in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the **Define these policy settings** check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.

**Default:**

-   Success on domain controllers.
-   No auditing on member servers.

## Configure this audit setting

You can configure this security setting by opening the appropriate policy under Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Audit Policy.
