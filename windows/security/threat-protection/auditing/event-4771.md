***Subcategory:***&nbsp;[Audit Kerberos Authentication Service](audit-kerberos-authentication-service.md)

***Event Description:***

This event generates every time the Key Distribution Center fails to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This problem can occur when a domain controller doesn’t have a certificate installed for smart card authentication (for example, with a “Domain Controller” or “Domain Controller Authentication” template), the user’s password has expired, or the wrong password was provided.

This event generates only on domain controllers.

This event is not generated if “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication” option is set for the account.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.

***Required Server Roles:*** Active Directory domain controller.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Account Information:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account object for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

    For example: CONTOSO\\dadmin or CONTOSO\\WIN81$.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name:** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of account, for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Computer account name ends with **$** character.

    -   User account example: dadmin

    -   Computer account example: WIN81$

**Service Information:**

-   **Service Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the name of the service in the Kerberos Realm to which TGT request was sent. Typically has one of the following formats:

    -   krbtgt/DOMAIN\_NETBIOS\_NAME. Example: krbtgt/CONTOSO

    -   krbtgt/DOMAIN\_FULL\_NAME. Example: krbtgt/CONTOSO.LOCAL

**Network Information:**

-   **Client Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** IP address of the computer from which the TGT request was received. Here are some examples of formats:

    -   **IPv6** or **IPv4** address.

    -   **::ffff:IPv4\_address**.

    -   **::1** - localhost.

-   **Client Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: source port number of client network connection (TGT request connection).

    -   0 for local (localhost) requests.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Ticket Options**: \[Type = HexInt32\]: this set of different Ticket Flags is in hexadecimal format.

    Example:

    -   Ticket Options: 0x40810010

    -   Binary view: 01000000100000010000000000010000

    -   Using **MSB 0**-bit numbering, we have bit 1, 8, 15 and 27 set = Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table below **“MSB 0”** bit numbering is used, because RFC documents use this style. In “MSB 0” style bit numbering begins from left.<br><img src="images/msb.png" alt="MSB illustration" width="224" height="57" />

The most common values:

-   0x40810010 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

-   0x40810000 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize

-   0x60810010 - Forwardable, Forwarded, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

| **High-value accounts**: You might have high-value domain or local accounts for which you need to monitor each action.<br>Examples of high-value accounts are database administrators, built-in local administrator account, domain administrators, service accounts, domain controller accounts and so on. | Monitor this event with the **“Security ID”** that corresponds to the high-value account or accounts.                                                              |
| **Anomalies or malicious actions**: You might have specific requirements for detecting anomalies or monitoring potential malicious actions. For example, you might need to monitor for use of an account outside of working hours.                                                                                | When you monitor for anomalies or malicious actions, use the **“Security ID”** (with other information) to monitor how or when a particular account is being used. |
| **Non-active accounts**: You might have non-active, disabled, or guest accounts, or other accounts that should never be used.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Monitor this event with the **“Security ID”** that corresponds to the accounts that should never be used.                                                          |
| **Account allow list**: You might have a specific allow list of accounts that are the only ones allowed to perform actions corresponding to particular events.                                                                                                                                                      | If this event corresponds to a “allow list-only” action, review the **“Security ID”** for accounts that are outside the allow list.                                  |
| **Account naming conventions**: Your organization might have specific naming conventions for account names.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Monitor “**Subject\\Account Name”** for names that don’t comply with naming conventions.                                                                           |

-   You can track all [4771](event-4771.md) events where the **Client Address** is not from your internal IP range or not from private IP ranges.

-   If you know that **Account Name** should be used only from known list of IP addresses, track all **Client Address** values for this **Account Name** in [4771](event-4771.md) events. If **Client Address** is not from the allow list, generate the alert.

-   All **Client Address** = ::1 means local authentication. If you know the list of accounts that should log on to the domain controllers, then you need to monitor for all possible violations, where **Client Address** = ::1 and **Account Name** is not allowed to log on to any domain controller.

-   All [4771](event-4771.md) events with **Client Port** field value &gt; 0 and &lt; 1024 should be examined, because a well-known port was used for outbound connection.

-   Also monitor the fields shown in the following table, to discover the issues listed:

| **Field**                   | **Issue to discover**                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 2** when only standard password authentication is in use in the organization. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                      |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 138** when Kerberos Armoring is enabled for all Kerberos communications in the organization. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).       |
| **Failure Code**             | **0x10** (KDC has no support for PADATA type (pre-authentication data)). This error can help you to more quickly identify smart-card related problems with Kerberos authentication.                                          |
| **Failure Code**             | **0x18** ((Pre-authentication information was invalid), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This issue can indicate a brute-force attack on the account password, especially for highly critical accounts. |
