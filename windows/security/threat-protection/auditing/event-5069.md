# 5069(S, F): A cryptographic function property operation was attempted.


This event generates in [BCryptSetContextFunctionProperty](/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptsetcontextfunctionproperty)() function. This function is a Cryptographic Next Generation (CNG) function.

This event generates when named property for a cryptographic function in an existing CNG context was added or removed.
