# Audit object access


Determines whether to audit the event of a user accessing an object--for example, a file, folder, registry key, printer, and so forth--that has its own system access control list (SACL) specified.

If you define this policy setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, audit failures, or not audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when a user successfully accesses an object that has an appropriate SACL specified. Failure audits generate an audit entry when a user unsuccessfully attempts to access an object that has a SACL specified.

To set this value to **No auditing**, in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the Define these policy settings check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set a SACL on a file system object using the **Security** tab in that object's **Properties** dialog box.

**Default:** No auditing.

## Configure this audit setting

You can configure this security setting by opening the appropriate policy under Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Audit Policy.
