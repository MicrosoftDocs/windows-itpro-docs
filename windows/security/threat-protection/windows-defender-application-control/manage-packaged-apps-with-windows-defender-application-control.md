# Manage Packaged Apps with Windows Defender Application Control 

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 11
-   Windows Server 2016 and above

>[!NOTE]
>Some capabilities of Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) are only available on specific Windows versions. Learn more about the [Windows Defender Application Control feature availability](feature-availability.md).

This topic for IT professionals describes concepts and lists procedures to help you manage packaged apps with Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) as part of your overall application control strategy.

## Understanding Packaged Apps and Packaged App Installers

Packaged apps, also known as Universal Windows apps, are based on a model that ensures all the files within an app package share the same identity. With classic Windows apps, each file within the app could have a unique identity. 
With packaged apps, it's possible to control the entire app by using a single Windows Defender Application Control rule.
 
Typically, an app consists of multiple components: the installer that is used to install the app, and one or more exes, dlls, or scripts. With classic Windows apps, these components don't always share common attributes such as the software’s publisher name, product name, and product version. Therefore, Windows Defender Application Control controls each of these components separately through different rule collections, such as exe, dll, script, and Windows Installer rules. In contrast, all the components of a packaged app share the same publisher name, package name, and package version attributes. Therefore, you can control an entire app with a single rule.

### <a href="" id="bkmk-compareclassicmetro"></a>Comparing classic Windows Apps and Packaged Apps

Windows Defender Application Control policies for packaged apps can only be applied to apps installed on computers running at least Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8, but classic Windows apps can be controlled on devices running at least Windows Server 
2008 R2 or Windows 7. The rules for classic Windows apps and packaged apps can be enforced in tandem. The differences between packaged apps and classic Windows apps that you should consider include:

-   **Installing the apps**   All packaged apps can be installed by a standard user, whereas many classic Windows apps require administrative privileges to install. In an environment where most of the users are standard users, you might not have numerous exe rules (because classic Windows apps require administrative privileges to install), but you might want to have more explicit policies for packaged apps.
-   **Changing the system state**   Classic Windows apps can be written to change the system state if they're run with administrative privileges. Most packaged apps can't change the system state because they run with limited privileges. When you design your Windows Defender Application Control policies, it's important to understand whether an app that you're allowing can make system-wide changes.
-   **Acquiring the apps**   Packaged apps can be acquired through the Store, or by loading using Windows PowerShell cmdlets (which requires a special enterprise license). Classic Windows apps can be acquired through traditional means.

Windows Defender Application Control uses different rule collections to control packaged apps and classic Windows apps. You have the choice to control one type, the other type, or both.

## Using WDAC to Manage Packaged Apps

Just as there are differences in managing each rule collection, you need to manage the packaged apps with the following strategy:

1.  Gather information about which packaged apps are running in your environment. 

2.  Create WDAC rules for specific packaged apps based on your policy strategies. For more information, see [Deploy Windows Defender Application Control policy (WDAC) rules and file rules](select-types-of-rules-to-create.md).

3.  Continue to update the WDAC policies as new package apps are introduced into your environment. For information on how to do this update, see [Merge WDAC policies](merge-windows-defender-application-control-policies.md).

## Blocking Packaged Apps

You can now use `New-CIPolicyRule -Package $Package -Deny` to block packaged apps.

### Blocking Packaged Apps Which Are Installed on the System

Below are the list of steps you can follow to block one or more packaged apps in the case that the apps are on the system you're using the WDAC PowerShell cmdlets on:

1. Get the app identifier for an installed package

   ```powershell
   $package = Get-AppxPackage -name *<example_app>*
   ```
   Where the name of the app is surrounded by asterisks, for example &ast;windowsstore&ast;
   
2. Make a rule by using the New-CIPolicyRule cmdlet

   ```powershell   
   $Rule = New-CIPolicyRule -Package $package -deny
   ```
3. Repeat for other packages you want to block using $rule +=…

4. Make a policy for just the blocks you created for packages

   ```powershell
   New-CIpolicy -rules $rule -f .\policy.xml -u
   ```

5. Merge with an existing policy that authorizes the other applications and system components required for your scenario. Here we use the sample Allow Windows policy

   ```powershell
   Merge-CIPolicy -PolicyPaths .\policy.xml,C:\windows\Schemas\codeintegrity\examplepolicies\DefaultWindows_Audit.xml -o allowWindowsDenyPackages.xml
   ```

6. Disable audit mode if needed

   ```powershell
   Set-RuleOption -o 3 -Delete .\allowWindowsDenyPackages.xml
   ```

7. Enable invalidate EAs on reboot

   ```powershell
   Set-RuleOption -o 15 .\allowWindowsDenyPackages.xml 
   ```

8. Compile the policy

   ```powershell
   ConvertFrom-CIPolicy .\AllowWindowsDenyPackages.xml C:\compiledpolicy.bin
   ```

9. Install the policy without restarting

   ```powershell
   Invoke-CimMethod -Namespace root\Microsoft\Windows\CI -ClassName PS_UpdateAndCompareCIPolicy -MethodName Update -Arguments @{FilePath = "C:\compiledpolicy.bin"}
   ```
   ### Blocking Packaged Apps Which Aren't Installed on the System

If the app you intend to block isn't installed on the system you're using the WDAC PowerShell cmdlets on, then follow the steps below:

1. Create a dummy rule using Steps 1-5 in the Blocking Packaged Apps Which Are Installed on the System section above

2. Navigate to the app you want to block on the Store website

3. Copy the GUID in the URL for the app
    - Example: the GUID for the Microsoft To-Do app is 9nblggh5r558
    - `https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-to-do-list-task-reminder/9nblggh5r558?activetab=pivot:overviewtab` 
4. Use the GUID in the following REST query URL to retrieve the identifiers for the app
   - Example: for the Microsoft To-Do app, the URL would be `https://bspmts.mp.microsoft.com/v1/public/catalog/Retail/Products/9nblggh5r558/applockerdata`
   - The URL will return:
   
   ```
   { "packageFamilyName": "Microsoft.Todos_8wekyb3d8bbwe", 
    "packageIdentityName": "Microsoft.Todos", 
    "windowsPhoneLegacyId": "6088f001-776c-462e-984d-25b6399c6607", 
    "publisherCertificateName": "CN=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US" 
   }
   ```

5. Use the value returned by the query URL for the packageFamilyName to replace the package name generated earlier in the dummy rule from Step 1. 

## Allowing Packaged Apps
The method for allowing specific packaged apps is similar to the method outlined above for blocking packaged apps, with the only difference being the parameter to the New-CIPolicyRule cmdlet.

```powershell   
$Rule = New-CIPolicyRule -Package $package -allow
```

Since many system apps are packaged apps, it's recommended that customers rely on the sample policies in `C:\Windows\schemas\CodeIntegrity\ExamplePolicies` to help allow all inbox apps by the Store signature already included in the policies and control apps with deny rules.
