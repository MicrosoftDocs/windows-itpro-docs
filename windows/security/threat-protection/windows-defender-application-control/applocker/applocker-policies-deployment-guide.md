# AppLocker deployment guide

**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 and above

> [!NOTE]
> Some capabilities of Windows Defender Application Control are only available on specific Windows versions. Learn more about the [Windows Defender Application Control feature availability](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/feature-availability).

This topic for IT professionals introduces the concepts and describes the steps required to deploy AppLocker policies.

This guide provides steps based on your design and planning investigation for deploying application control policies by using AppLocker. It's intended for security architects, security administrators, and system administrators. Through a sequential and iterative deployment process, you can create application control policies, test and adjust the policies, and implement a method for maintaining those policies as the needs in your organization change.

This guide covers the use of Software Restriction Policies (SRP) in conjunction with AppLocker policies to control application usage. For a comparison of SRP and AppLocker, see [Using Software Restriction Policies and AppLocker policies](using-software-restriction-policies-and-applocker-policies.md) in this guide. To understand if AppLocker is the correct application control solution for you, see [Understand AppLocker policy design decisions](understand-applocker-policy-design-decisions.md).

## Prerequisites to deploying AppLocker policies

The following are prerequisites or recommendations to deploying policies:

-   Understand the capabilities of AppLocker:
    -   [AppLocker](applocker-overview.md)
-   Document your application control policy deployment plan by addressing these tasks:
    -   [Understand the AppLocker policy deployment process](understand-the-applocker-policy-deployment-process.md)
    -   [Understand AppLocker policy design decisions](understand-applocker-policy-design-decisions.md)
    -   [Determine your application control objectives](determine-your-application-control-objectives.md)
    -   [Create list of apps deployed to each business group](create-list-of-applications-deployed-to-each-business-group.md)
    -   [Select types of rules to create](select-types-of-rules-to-create.md)
    -   [Determine Group Policy Structure and rule enforcement](determine-group-policy-structure-and-rule-enforcement.md)
    -   [Plan for AppLocker policy management](plan-for-applocker-policy-management.md)
