# Requirements to use AppLocker

**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 and above

This topic for the IT professional lists software requirements to use AppLocker on the supported Windows operating systems.

## General requirements

To use AppLocker, you need:

-   A device running a supported operating system to create the rules. The computer can be a domain controller.
-   For Group Policy deployment, at least one device with the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) installed to host the AppLocker rules.
-   Devices running a supported operating system to enforce the AppLocker rules that you create.

>[!NOTE]
>As of [KB 5024351](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5024351), Windows 10 versions 2004 and newer and all Windows 11 versions no longer require a specific edition of Windows to enforce AppLocker policies
