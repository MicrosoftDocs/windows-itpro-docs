# Using Event Viewer with AppLocker

**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 and above

>[!NOTE]
>Some capabilities of Windows Defender Application Control are only available on specific Windows versions. Learn more about the [Windows Defender Application Control feature availability](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/feature-availability).

This article lists AppLocker events and describes how to use Event Viewer with AppLocker.

The AppLocker log contains information about applications that are affected by AppLocker rules. Each event in the log contains details such as the following information:

- Which file is affected and the path of that file
- Which packaged app is affected and the package identifier of the app
- Whether the file or packaged app is allowed or blocked
- The rule type (path, file hash, or publisher)
- The rule name
- The security identifier (SID) for the user or group identified in the rule

Review the entries in the Event Viewer to determine if any applications aren't included in the rules that you automatically generated. For instance, some line-of-business apps are installed to non-standard locations, such as the root of the active drive (for example, `%SystemDrive%`).

For info about what to look for in the AppLocker event logs, see [Monitor app usage with AppLocker](monitor-application-usage-with-applocker.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The AppLocker event logs are very verbose and can result in a large number of events depending on the policies deployed, particularly in the *AppLocker - EXE and DLL* event log. If you're using an event forwarding and collection service, like LogAnalytics, you may want to adjust the configuration for that event log to only collect Error events or stop collecting events from that log altogether.

**To review the AppLocker log in Event Viewer**

1. Open Event Viewer.
2. In the console tree under **Application and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows**, select **AppLocker**.

The following table contains information about the events that you can use to determine which apps are affected by AppLocker rules.
