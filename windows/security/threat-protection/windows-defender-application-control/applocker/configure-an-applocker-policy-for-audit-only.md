# Configure an AppLocker policy for audit only

**Applies to**

- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 and above

This topic for IT professionals describes how to set AppLocker policies to **Audit only** within your IT environment by using AppLocker.

After AppLocker rules are created within the rule collection, you can configure the enforcement setting to **Enforce rules** or **Audit only**.

When AppLocker policy enforcement is set to **Enforce rules**, rules are enforced for the rule collection and all events are audited. When AppLocker policy enforcement is set to **Audit only**, rules are only evaluated but all events generated from that evaluation are written to the AppLocker log.
Â 
You can perform this task by using the Group Policy Management Console for an AppLocker policy in a Group Policy Object (GPO) or by using the Local Security Policy snap-in for an AppLocker policy on a local computer or in a security template. For info how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer AppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).

**To audit rule collections**

1.  From the AppLocker console, right-click **AppLocker**, and then click **Properties**.
2.  On the **Enforcement** tab, select the **Configured** check box for the rule collection that you want to enforce, and then verify that **Audit only** is selected in the list for that rule collection.
3.  Repeat the above step to configure the enforcement setting to **Audit only** for additional rule collections.
4.  Click **OK**.
