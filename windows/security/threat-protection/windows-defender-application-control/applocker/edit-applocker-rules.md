This topic for IT professionals describes the steps to edit a publisher rule, path rule, and file hash rule in AppLocker.

For more info about these rule types, see [Understanding AppLocker rule condition types](understanding-applocker-rule-condition-types.md).

You can perform this task by using the Group Policy Management Console for an AppLocker policy in a Group Policy Object (GPO) or by using the Local Security Policy snap-in for an AppLocker policy on a local computer or in a security template. For info how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer AppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).

3.  Click the appropriate tab to edit the rule properties.

    -   Click the **General** tab to change the rule name, add a rule description, configure whether the rule is used to allow or deny applications, and set the security group for which this rule should apply.
