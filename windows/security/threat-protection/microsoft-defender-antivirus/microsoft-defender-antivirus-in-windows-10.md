# Next-generation protection in Windows

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/)

## Microsoft Defender Antivirus: Your next-generation protection

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is the next-generation protection component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This protection brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices in your enterprise organization. Your next-generation protection services include the following capabilities:

- [Behavior-based, heuristic, and real-time antivirus protection](configure-protection-features-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes always-on scanning using file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as *real-time protection*). It also includes detecting and blocking apps that are deemed unsafe, but might not be detected as malware.
- [Cloud-delivered protection](utilize-microsoft-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats.
- [Dedicated protection and product updates](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), which includes updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date.

## Try a demo!

Visit the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint demo website](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the following protection features are working and explore them using demo scenarios:
- Cloud-delivered protection
- Block at first sight (BAFS) protection
- Potentially unwanted applications (PUA) protection

## Minimum system requirements

Microsoft Defender Antivirus has the same hardware requirements as of Windows 10. For more information, see the following resources:

- [Minimum hardware requirements](/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview)
- [Hardware component guidelines](/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/components)

## Configure next-generation protection services

For information on how to configure next-generation protection services, see [Configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus features](configure-microsoft-defender-antivirus-features.md).

> [!Note]  
> Configuration and management is largely the same in Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019, while running Microsoft Defender Antivirus; however, there are some differences.
