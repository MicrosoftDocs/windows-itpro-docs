# System Guard Secure Launch and SMM protection

**Applies to:**

- Windows 11
- Windows 10

This topic explains how to configure [System Guard Secure Launch and System Management Mode (SMM) protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-system-guard/how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows) to improve the startup security of Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. The information below is presented from a client perspective.

> [!NOTE]
> System Guard Secure Launch feature requires a supported processor. For more information, see [System requirements for System Guard](how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows.md#system-requirements-for-system-guard).

## How to enable System Guard Secure Launch

You can enable System Guard Secure Launch by using any of these options:

- [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](#mobile-device-management)
- [Group Policy](#group-policy)
- [Windows Security app](#windows-security-app)
- [Registry](#registry)

### Mobile Device Management

System Guard Secure Launch can be configured for Mobile Device Management (MDM) by using DeviceGuard policies in the Policy CSP, [DeviceGuard/ConfigureSystemGuardLaunch](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deviceguard#deviceguard-configuresystemguardlaunch).

### Group Policy

1. Click **Start** > type and then click **Edit group policy**.

2. Click **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Device Guard** > **Turn On Virtualization Based Security** > **Secure Launch Configuration**.

### Registry

1. Open Registry editor.

2. Click **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** > **SYSTEM** > **CurrentControlSet** > **Control** > **DeviceGuard** > **Scenarios**.

3. Right-click **Scenarios** > **New** > **Key** and name the new key **SystemGuard**.

4. Right-click **SystemGuard** > **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value** and name the new DWORD **Enabled**.
