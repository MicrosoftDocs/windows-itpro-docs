# Tech support scams

Tech support scams are an industry-wide issue where scammers use scare tactics to trick users into paying for unnecessary technical support services that supposedly fix contrived device, platform, or software problems.

## How tech support scams work

Scammers may call you directly on your phone and pretend to be representatives of a software company. They might even spoof the caller ID so that it displays a legitimate support phone number from a trusted company. They can then ask you to install applications that give them remote access to your device. Using remote access, these experienced scammers can misrepresent normal system output as signs of problems.

Scammers might also initiate contact by displaying fake error messages on websites you visit, displaying support numbers and enticing you to call. They can also put your browser on full screen and display pop-up messages that won't go away, essentially locking your browser. These fake error messages aim to trick you into calling an indicated technical support hotline. Note that Microsoft error and warning messages never include phone numbers.

When you engage with the scammers, they can offer fake solutions for your “problems” and ask for payment in the form of a one-time fee or subscription to a purported support service.

## How to protect against tech support scams

Share and implement the general tips on how to [prevent malware infection](prevent-malware-infection.md).

It is also important to keep the following in mind:

* Microsoft does not send unsolicited email messages or make unsolicited phone calls to request personal or financial information, or to fix your computer.

* Any communication with Microsoft has to be initiated by you.

* Don’t call the number in the pop-ups. Microsoft’s error and warning messages never include a phone number.

* Download software only from official vendor websites or the Microsoft Store. Be wary of downloading software from third-party sites, as some of them might have been modified without the author’s knowledge to bundle support scam malware and other threats.

* Use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge) when browsing the internet. It blocks known support scam sites using Windows Defender SmartScreen (which is also used by Internet Explorer). Furthermore, Microsoft Edge can stop pop-up dialogue loops used by these sites.

* Enable [Windows Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10) in Windows 10. It detects and removes known support scam malware.

## What to do if information has been given to a tech support person

* Uninstall applications that scammers asked to be install. If access has been granted, consider resetting the device

* Run a full scan with Windows Defender Antivirus to remove any malware. Apply all security updates as soon as they are available.

* Change passwords.

* Call your credit card provider to reverse the charges, if you have already paid.

* Monitor anomalous logon activity. Use Windows Defender Firewall to block traffic to services that you would not normally access.
