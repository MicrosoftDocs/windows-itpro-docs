# Industry collaboration programs

Microsoft has several industry-wide collaboration programs with different objectives and requirements. Enrolling in the right program can help you protect your customers, gain more insight into the current threat landscape, or assist in disrupting the malware ecosystem.

## Virus Information Alliance (VIA)

The VIA program gives members access to information that will help improve protection for Microsoft customers. Malware telemetry and samples can be provided to security teams to help identify gaps in their protection, prioritize new threat coverage, or better respond to threats.

**You must be a member of VIA if you want to apply for membership to the other programs.**

Go to the [VIA program page](virus-information-alliance-criteria.md) for more information.

## Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI)

MVI is open to organizations who build and own a Real Time Protection (RTP) antimalware product of their own design, or one developed using a third-party antivirus SDK.

Members get access to Microsoft client APIs for the Microsoft Defender Security Center, IOAV, AMSI, and Cloud Files, along with health data and other telemetry to help their customers stay protected. Antimalware products are submitted to Microsoft for performance testing on a regular basis.

Go to the [MVI program page](virus-initiative-criteria.md) for more information.

## Coordinated Malware Eradication (CME)

CME is open to organizations who are involved in cybersecurity and antimalware or interested in fighting cybercrime.

The program aims to bring organizations in cybersecurity and other industries together to pool tools, information and actions to drive coordinated campaigns against malware. The ultimate goal is to create efficient and long-lasting results for better protection of our collective communities, customers, and businesses.

Go to the [CME program page](coordinated-malware-eradication.md) for more information.
