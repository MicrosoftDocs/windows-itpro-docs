# Submit files for analysis

If you have a file that you suspect might be malware or is being incorrectly detected, you can submit it to us for analysis. This page has answers to some common questions about submitting a file for analysis.

## How do I send a malware file to Microsoft?

You can send us files that you think might be malware or files that have been incorrectly detected through the [sample submission portal](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission).

We receive a large number of samples from many sources. Our analysis is prioritized by the number of file detections and the type of submission. You can help us complete a quick analysis by providing detailed information about the product you were using and what you were doing when you found the file.

If you sign in before you submit a sample, you will be able to track your submissions.

## Can I send a sample by email?

No, we only accept submissions through our [sample submission portal](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission).

## Can I submit a sample without signing in?

Yes, you many submit a file as an anonymous home customer. You will get a link to a webpage where you can view the status of the submission.

If you're an enterprise customer, you need to sign in so that we can prioritize your submission appropriately. If you are currently experiencing a virus outbreak or security-related incident, you should contact your designated Microsoft support professional or go to [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/) for immediate assistance.

## What is the Software Assurance ID (SAID)?

The [Software Assurance ID (SAID)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default.aspx) is for enterprise customers to track support entitlements. The submission portal accepts and retains SAID information and allows customers with valid SAIDs to make higher priority submissions.

### How do I dispute the detection of my program?

[Submit the file](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission) in question as a software developer. Wait until your submission has a final determination.

If you’re not satisfied with our determination of the submission, use the developer contact form provided with the submission results to reach Microsoft. We will use the information you provide to investigate further if necessary.

We encourage all software vendors and developers to read about [how Microsoft identifies malware and unwanted software](criteria.md).

## How do I track or view past sample submissions?

You can track your submissions through the [submission history page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/submissionhistory). Your submission will only appear on this page if you were signed in when you submitted it.

If you’re not signed in when you submit a sample, you will be redirected to a tracking page. Bookmark this page if you want to come back and check on the status of your submission.

## What does the submission status mean?

Each submission is shown to be in one of the following status types:

* Submitted—the file has been received

* In progress—an analyst has started checking the file

* Closed—a final determination has been given by an analyst

If you are signed in, you can see the status of any files you submit to us on the [submission history page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/submissionhistory).

## How does Microsoft prioritize submissions

Processing submissions take dedicated analyst resource. Because we regularly receive a large number of submissions, we handle them based on a priority. The following factors affect how we prioritize submissions:

* Prevalent files with the potential to impact large numbers of computers are prioritized.

* Authenticated customers, especially enterprise customers with valid [Software Assurance IDs (SAIDs)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default.aspx), are given priority.

* Submissions flagged as high priority by SAID holders are given immediate attention.

Your submission is immediately scanned by our systems to give you the latest determination even before an analyst starts handling your case. Note that the same file may have already been processed by an analyst. To check for updates to the determination, select rescan on the submission details page.
