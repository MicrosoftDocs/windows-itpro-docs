# Coordinated Malware Eradication

![coordinated-malware-eradication](images/CoordinatedMalware.png)

Coordinated Malware Eradication (CME) aims to bring organizations in cybersecurity and in other industries together to change the game against malware. While the cybersecurity industry today is effective at disrupting malware families through individual efforts, those disruptions rarely lead to eradication since malware authors quickly adapt their tactics to survive.

CME calls for organizations to pool their tools, information and actions to drive coordinated campaigns against malware. The ultimate goal is to drive efficient and long lasting results for better protection of our collective communities, customers, and businesses.

## Combining our tools, information, and actions

Diversity of participation across industries and disciplines, extending beyond cybersecurity, makes eradication campaigns even stronger across the malware lifecycle. For instance, while security vendors, computer emergency response/readiness teams (CERTs), and Internet service providers (ISPs) can contribute with malware telemetry, online businesses can identify fraudulent behavior and law enforcement agencies can drive legal action.

In addition to telemetry and analysis data, Microsoft is planning to contribute cloud-based scalable storage and computing horsepower with the necessary big data analysis tools built-in to these campaigns.

## Coordinated campaigns for lasting results

Organizations participating in the CME effort work together to help eradicate selected malware families by contributing their own telemetry data, expertise, tools, and other resources. These organizations operate under a campaign umbrella with clearly defined end goals and metrics. Any organization or member can initiate a campaign and invite others to join it. The members then have the option to accept or decline the invitations they receive.

## Join the effort

Any organization that is involved in cybersecurity and antimalware or interested in fighting cybercrime can participate in CME campaigns by enrolling in the [Virus Information Alliance (VIA) program](virus-information-alliance-criteria.md). It ensures that everyone agrees to use the information and tools available for campaigns for their intended purpose (that is, the eradication of malware).

If your organization meets these criteria and is interested in joining, [apply for membership now](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/alliances/apply-alliance-membership).
