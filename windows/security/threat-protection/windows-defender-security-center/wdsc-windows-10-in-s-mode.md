# Manage Windows Security in Windows 10 in S mode

**Applies to**

- Windows 10 in S mode, version 1803

Windows 10 in S mode is streamlined for tighter security and superior performance. With Windows 10 in S mode, users can only use apps from the Microsoft Store, ensuring Microsoft-verified security so you can minimize malware attacks. In addition, using Microsoft Edge provides a more secure browser experience, with extra protections against phishing and malicious software.

The Windows Security interface is a little different in Windows 10 in S mode. The **Virus & threat protection** area has fewer options, because the built-in security of Windows 10 in S mode prevents viruses and other threats from running on devices in your organization. In addition, devices running Windows 10 in S mode receive security updates automatically.

For more information about Windows 10 in S mode, including how to switch out of S mode, see [Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise in S mode](/windows/deployment/windows-10-pro-in-s-mode).

## Managing Windows Security settings with Intune

In the enterprise, you can only manage security settings for devices running Windows 10 in S mode with Microsoft Intune or other mobile device management apps. Windows 10 in S mode prevents making changes via PowerShell scripts.

For information about using Intune to manage Windows Security settings on your organization's devices, see [Set up Intune](/intune/setup-steps) and [Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10 (and later) in Intune](/intune/endpoint-protection-windows-10).
