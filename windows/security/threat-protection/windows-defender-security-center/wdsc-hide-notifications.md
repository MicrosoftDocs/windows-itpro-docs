# Hide Windows Security app notifications

**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

The Windows Security app is used by many Windows security features to provide notifications about the health and security of the machine. These include notifications about firewalls, antivirus products, Windows Defender SmartScreen, and others.

In some cases, it may not be appropriate to show these notifications, for example, if you want to hide regular status updates, or if you want to hide all notifications to the employees in your organization.

There are two levels to hiding notifications:

1. Hide non-critical notifications, such as regular updates about the number of scans Microsoft Defender Antivirus ran in the past week
2. Hide all notifications

If you set **Hide all notifications** to **Enabled**, changing the **Hide non-critical notifications** setting will have no effect.

You can only use Group Policy to change these settings.



## Use Group Policy to hide non-critical notifications

You can hide notifications that describe regular events related to the health and security of the machine. These notifications are the ones that don't require an action from the machine's user. It can be useful to hide these notifications if you find they're too numerous or you have other status reporting on a larger scale (such as Update Compliance or Microsoft Configuration Manager reporting).

These notifications can be hidden only by using Group Policy.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Requirement: You must have Windows 10, version 1903 or higher. The ADMX/ADML template files for earlier versions of Windows do not include these Group Policy settings. 

1. Download the latest [Administrative Templates (.admx) for Windows 10, v2004](https://www.microsoft.com/download/101445).

2.  On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

3.  In **Group Policy Management Editor**, go to **Computer configuration** and click **Administrative templates**.

5.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Security > Notifications**. For Windows 10 version 1803 and below, the path would be **Windows components > Windows Defender Security Center > Notifications**

6.  Open the **Hide non-critical notifications** setting and set it to **Enabled**. Click **OK**.

7. [Deploy the updated GPO as you normally do](/windows/win32/srvnodes/group-policy). 


## Use Group Policy to hide all notifications

You can hide all notifications that are sourced from the Windows Security app. This option may be useful if you don't want users of the machines from inadvertently modifying settings, running antivirus scans, or otherwise performing security-related actions without your input.

These notifications can be hidden only by using Group Policy.
