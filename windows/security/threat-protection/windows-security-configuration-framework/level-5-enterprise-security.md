# Level 5 Enterprise Basic Security configuration 

**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10

Level 5 is the minimum security configuration for an enterprise device.
Microsoft recommends the following configuration for level 5 devices.

## Hardware

Devices targeting Level 5 should support the following hardware features:

- [Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-tpm)
- [Bitlocker Drive Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-bitlocker)
- [UEFI Secure Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot)
- Drivers and Firmware Distributed through Windows Update

## Policies

The policies in level 5 enforce a reasonable security level while minimizing the impact to users or to applications. 
Microsoft recommends using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates) for these security configurations and controls, noting that the timeline can generally be short given the limited potential impact of the security controls.

### Security Template Policies

| Feature                 | Policy Setting                                                                                   | Policy Value                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Account Lockout | Account Lockout Duration | 15 | The number of minutes a locked-out account remains locked out before automatically becoming unlocked. If an account lockout threshold is defined, the account lockout duration must be greater than or equal to the reset time. |
| Account Lockout | Account Lockout Threshold | 10 | The number of failed logon attempts that causes a user account to be locked out. A locked-out account cannot be used until it is reset by an administrator or until the lockout duration for the account has expired. |
| Account Lockout | Reset account lockout conter after | 15 | The number of minutes that must elapse after a failed logon attempt before the failed logon attempt counter is reset to 0 bad logon attempts. |
| Password Policy | Enforce password history | 24 | The number of unique new passwords that must be associated with a user account before an old password can be reused. |
| Password Policy | Minimum password length | 14 | The least number of characters that a password for a user account may contain. |
| Password Policy | Password must meet complexity requirements | Enabled | Determines whether passwords must meet complexity requirements:<br>1) Not contain the user's samAccountName (Account Name) value or entire displayName (Full Name value). Neither check is case sensitive.<br>The samAccountName is checked in its entirety only to determine whether it is part of the password. If the samAccountName is less than three characters long, this check is skipped. The displayName is parsed for delimiters: commas, periods, dashes or hyphens, underscores, spaces, pound signs, and tabs. If any of these delimiters are found, the displayName is split and all parsed sections (tokens) are confirmed to not be included in the password. Tokens that are less than three characters are ignored, and substrings of the tokens are not checked. For example, the name "Erin M. Hagens" is split into three tokens: "Erin", "M", and "Hagens". Because the second token is only one character long, it is ignored. Therefore, this user could not have a password that included either "erin" or "hagens" as a substring anywhere in the password.<br>2) Contain characters from three of the following categories:<br>- Uppercase letters of European languages (A through Z, with diacritic marks, Greek and Cyrillic characters)<br>- Lowercase letters of European languages (a through z, sharp-s, with diacritic marks, Greek and Cyrillic characters)<br>-  Base 10 digits (0 through 9)<br>-Non-alphanumeric characters (special characters):<br>(~!@#$%^&*_-+=`\|\\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/)<br>Currency symbols such as the Euro or British Pound are not counted as special characters for this policy setting.<br>- Any Unicode character that is categorized as an alphabetic character but is not uppercase or lowercase. This includes Unicode characters from Asian languages. |
| Password Policy | Store passwords using reversible encryption | Disabled | Determines whether the operating system stores passwords using reversible encryption. |
| Security Options | Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If enabled, local accounts that are not password protected will only be able to log on at the computer's keyboard.  |
| Security Options | Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings | Enabled  | Windows Vista and later versions of Windows allow audit policy to be managed in a more precise way using audit policy subcategories. Setting audit policy at the category level will override the new subcategory audit policy feature. Group Policy only allows audit policy to be set at the category level, and existing Group Policy may override the subcategory settings of new machines as they are joined to the domain or upgraded. To allow audit policy to be managed using subcategories without requiring a change to Group Policy, there is a new registry value in Windows Vista and later versions, SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy, which prevents the application of category-level audit policy from Group Policy and from the Local Security Policy administrative tool. |
| Security Options | Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. This setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member meets minimum security requirements. Specifically, it determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. If this policy is enabled, then the secure channel will not be established unless either signing or encryption of all secure channel traffic is negotiated. If this policy is disabled, then encryption and signing of all secure channel traffic is negotiated with the Domain Controller in which case the level of signing and encryption depends on the version of the Domain Controller and the settings of the following two policies:<br>- Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)<br>- Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)  |
| Security Options | Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether a domain member attempts to negotiate encryption for all secure channel traffic that it initiates. If enabled, the domain member will request encryption of all secure channel traffic. If the domain controller supports encryption of all secure channel traffic, then all secure channel traffic will be encrypted. Otherwise, only logon information transmitted over the secure channel will be encrypted. If this setting is disabled, then the domain member will not attempt to negotiate secure channel encryption.  |
| Security Options | Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether a domain member attempts to negotiate signing for all secure channel traffic that it initiates. If enabled, the domain member will request signing of all secure channel traffic. If the Domain Controller supports signing of all secure channel traffic, then all secure channel traffic will be signed, which ensures that it cannot be tampered with in transit.  |
| Security Options | Domain member: Disable machine account password changes | Disabled | Determines whether a domain member periodically changes its computer account password. |
| Security Options | Domain member: Maximum machine account password age | 30 | Determines how often a domain member will attempt to change its computer account password |
| Security Options | Domain member: require strong (Windows 2000 or later) session key | Enabled | Determines whether 128-bit key strength is required for encrypted secure channel data |
| Security Options | Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit | 900 | The number of seconds of inactivity before the session is locked |
| Security Options | Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior  | Lock Workstation  | This security setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. If you click **Lock Workstation** in the **Properties** for this policy, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart cards with them, and still maintain protected sessions. For this setting to work beginning with Windows Vista, the Smart Card Removal Policy service must be started.  |
| Security Options | Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.  |
| Security Options | Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted password to third party SMB servers| Disabled | If this security setting is enabled, the Server Message Block (SMB) redirector can send plaintext passwords to non-Microsoft SMB servers that do not support password encryption during authentication. Sending unencrypted passwords is a security risk. |
| Security Options | Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server component.  |
| Security Options | Network access: Allow anonymous SID/Name translation | Disabled | This security setting determines if an anonymous user can request security identifier (SID) attributes for another user. If this policy is enabled, a user with knowledge of an administrator's SID could contact a computer that has this policy enabled and use the SID to get the administrator's name. |
| Security Options | Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts  | Enabled  | This security setting determines what additional permissions will be granted for anonymous connections to the computer. Windows allows anonymous users to perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust. This security option allows additional restrictions to be placed on anonymous connections as follows: Enabled: Do not allow enumeration of SAM accounts. This option replaces Everyone with Authenticated Users in the security permissions for resources.  |
| Security Options | Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares is allowed. Windows allows anonymous users to perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust. If you do not want to allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares, then enable this policy.  |
| Security Options | Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares  | Enabled  | When enabled, this security setting restricts anonymous access to shares and pipes to the settings for:<br>- Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously<br>- Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously  |
| Security Options | Network access: Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM | O:BAG:BAD:(A;;RC;;;BA) | This policy setting allows you to restrict remote RPC connections to SAM. If not selected, the default security descriptor will be used. |
| Security Options | Network security: Allow LocalSystem NULL session fallback | Disabled | Allow NTLM to fall back to NULL session when used with LocalSystem |
| Security Options | Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change | Enabled | This security setting determines if, at the next password change, the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack, as compared with the cryptographically stronger Windows NT hash. Since the LM hash is stored on the local computer in the security database the passwords can be compromised if the security database is attacked. |
| Security Options | Network security: LAN Manager authentication level | Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM | This security setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers as follows: Send NTLMv2 response only\\refuse LM & NTLM: Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). |
| Security Options | Network security: LDAP client signing requirements  | Negotiate signing  | This security setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients issuing LDAP BIND requests, as follows: Negotiate signing: If Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS\\SSL) has not been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the LDAP data signing option set in addition to the options specified by the caller. If TLS\\SSL has been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the options that are specified by the caller.  |
| Security Options | Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients | Require NTLMv2 session security and Require 128-bit encryption | This security setting allows a client to require the negotiation of 128-bit encryption and/or NTLMv2 session security. These values are dependent on the LAN Manager Authentication Level security setting value. |
| Security Options | Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) servers | Require NTLMv2 session security and Require 128-bit encryption | This security setting allows a server to require the negotiation of 128-bit encryption and/or NTLMv2 session security. These values are dependent on the LAN Manager Authentication Level security setting value. |
| Security Options | System objects: Strengthen default permissions of internal system objects (e.g. Symbolic Links)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines the strength of the default discretionary access control list (DACL) for objects. Active Directory maintains a global list of shared system resources, such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. In this way, objects can be located and shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects and what permissions are granted. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing users who are not administrators to read shared objects but not allowing these users to modify shared objects that they did not create.  |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Admin approval mode for the built-in administrator | Enabled | The built-in Administrator account uses Admin Approval Mode - any operation that requires elevation of privilege will prompt to user to approve that operation |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode | Prompt for consent on the secure desktop | When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to enter a privileged user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege. |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation | Enabled | When an application installation package is detected that requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege. |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations | Enabled | This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system. Secure locations are limited to the following: - …\\Program Files\\, including subfolders - …\\Windows\\system32\\ - …\\Program Files (x86)\\, including subfolders for 64-bit versions of Windows |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Run all Administrators in admin approval mode | Enabled | This policy must be enabled, and related UAC policy settings must also be set appropriately to allow the built-in Administrator account and all other users who are members of the Administrators group to run in Admin Approval Mode. |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Virtualize file and registry write failures to per-user locations | Enabled | This policy setting controls whether application write failures are redirected to defined registry and file system locations. This policy setting mitigates applications that run as administrator and write run-time application data to %ProgramFiles%, %Windir%, %Windir%\\system32, or HKLM\\Software. |
| User Rights Assignments | Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller | No One (blank) | This setting is used by Credential Manager during Backup/Restore. No accounts should have this privilege, as it is only assigned to Winlogon. Users saved credentials might be compromised if this privilege is given to other entities.|
| User Rights Assignment | Access this computer from the network | Administrators; Remote Desktop Users | This user right determines which users and groups can connect to the computer over the network. Remote Desktop Services are not affected by this user right. |
| User Rights Assignments | Act as part of the operating system | No One (blank) | This user right allows a process to impersonate any user without authentication. The process can therefore gain access to the same local resources as that user. |
| User Rights Assignments | Allow log on locally | Administrators; Users | Determines which users can log on to the computer |
| User Rights Assignments | Back up files and directories | Administrators | Determines which users can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system |
| User Rights Assignments | Create a pagefile | Administrators | Determines which users and groups can call an internal application programming interface (API) to create and change the size of a page file |
| User Rights Assignments | Create a token object | No One (blank) | Determines which accounts can be used by processes to create a token that can then be used to get access to any local resources when the process uses an internal application programming interface (API) to create an access token. |
| User Rights Assignments | Create global objects | Administrators; LOCAL SERVICE; NETWORK SERVICE; SERVICE | This security setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. |
| User Rights Assignments | Create permanent shared objects | No One (blank) | Determines which accounts can be used by processes to create a directory object using the object manager |
| User Rights Assignments | Debug programs | Administrators | Determines which users can attach a debugger to any process or to the kernel. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned this user right. Developers who are debugging new system components will need this user right to be able to do so. This user right provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components. |
| User Rights Assignment | Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation | No One (blank) | This security setting determines which users can set the Trusted for Delegation setting on a user or computer object. |
| User Rights Assignments | Force shutdown from a remote system  | Administrators | Determines which users can shut down a computer from a remote location on the network. Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service. |
| User Rights Assignment | Impersonate a client after authentication | Administrators, SERVICE, Local Service, Network Service | Assigning this privilege to a user allows programs running on behalf of that user to impersonate a client. Requiring this user right for this kind of impersonation prevents an unauthorized user from convincing a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created and then impersonating that client, which can elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. |
| User Rights Assignments | Load and unload device drivers | Administrators | Determines which users can dynamically load and unload device drivers or other code in to kernel mode. This user right does not apply to Plug and Play device drivers. |
| User Rights Assignment | Lock pages in memory | No One (blank) | Determines which accounts can use a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. Exercising this privilege could significantly affect system performance by decreasing the amount of available random-access memory (RAM). |
| User Rights Assignments | Manage auditing and security log | Administrators | Determines which users can specify object access auditing options for individual resources, such as files, Active Directory objects, and registry keys. |
| User Rights Assignments | Modify firmware environment variables  | Administrators | Determines who can modify firmware environment values. Firmware environment variables are settings stored in the nonvolatile RAM of non-x86-based computers. The effect of the setting depends on the processor. |
| User Rights Assignment | Perform volume maintenance tasks | Administrators | This security setting determines which users and groups can run maintenance tasks on a volume, such as remote defragmentation. |
| User Rights Assignment | Profile single process | Administrators | This security setting determines which users can use performance monitoring tools to monitor the performance of non-system processes. |
| User Rights Assignments | Restore files and directories | Administrators | Determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent objects permissions when restoring backed up files and directories, and determines which users can set any valid security principal as the owner of an object |
| User Rights Assignments | Take ownership of files or other objects | Administrators | Determines which users can take ownership of any securable object in the system, including Active Directory objects, files and folders, printers, registry keys, processes, and threads |

### Computer Policies

| Feature | Policy Setting | Policy Value | Description |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| LAPS | Enable local admin password management | Enabled | Activates LAPS for the device |
| MS Security Guide | Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logon | Enabled | Filters the user account token for built-in administrator accounts for network logons |
| MS Security Guide | Configure SMB v1 client driver  | Disable driver (recommended) | Configure the startup mode for the kernel mode driver that implements client-side SMBv1 processing (MrxSmb10). This setting includes a dropdown that is activated when the Enabled radio button is selected and that controls the “Start” registry value in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MrxSmb10. |
| MS Security Guide | Configure SMB v1 server | Disabled | Disable or enable server-side processing of the SMBv1 protocol |
| MS Security Guide | Enabled Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP)| Enabled | This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore, it helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled with the latest improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option. We recommend that Windows users who are running any of the above operating systems enable this feature to improve the security profile of their systems. |
| MS Security Guide | NetBT NodeType Configuration | P-node (recommended) | The NetBT NodeType setting determines what methods NetBT uses to register and resolve names:<br/>- A B-node computer uses broadcasts.<br/>- A P-node computer uses only point-to-point name queries to a name server (WINS).<br/>- An M-node computer broadcasts first, and then queries the name server.<br/>- An H-node computer queries the name server first, and then broadcasts.<br/>Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the NodeType value is present, it overrides any DhcpNodeType value.<br/>If neither NodeType nor DhcpNodeType is present, the computer uses B-node if there are no WINS servers configured for the network, or H-node if there is at least one WINS server configured. |
| MS Security Guide | WDigest Authentication | Disabled | When the WDigest Authentication protocol is enabled, plain text passwords are stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) exposing them to theft. WDigest is disabled by default in Windows 10. This setting ensures this is enforced. |

Outdated ActiveX controls are never blocked in the Intranet Zone. |
| Windows Components / Internet Explorer / Security Features / Consistent Mime Handling | Internet Explorer Processes | Enabled | Internet Explorer uses Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) data to determine file handling procedures for files received through a Web server. This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer requires that all file-type information provided by Web servers be consistent. For example, if the MIME type of a file is text/plain but the MIME sniff indicates that the file is really an executable file, Internet Explorer renames the file by saving it in the Internet Explorer cache and changing its extension. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer requires consistent MIME data for all received files. |
| Windows Components / Internet Explorer / Security Features / Mime Sniffing Safety Feature | Internet Explorer Processes | Enabled | This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer MIME sniffing will prevent promotion of a file of one type to a more dangerous file type. If you enable this policy setting, MIME sniffing will never promote a file of one type to a more dangerous file type. |

| Windows Components / Internet Explorer / Security Features / Protection from Zone Elevation | Internet Explorer Processes | Enabled | Internet Explorer places restrictions on each Web page it opens. The restrictions are dependent upon the location of the Web page (Internet, Intranet, Local Machine zone, etc.). Web pages on the local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making the Local Machine security zone a prime target for malicious users. Zone Elevation also disables JavaScript navigation if there is no security context. If you enable this policy setting, any zone can be protected from zone elevation by Internet Explorer processes. |
| Windows Components / Internet Explorer / Security Features / Restrict ActiveX Install | Internet Explorer Processes | Enabled | This policy setting enables blocking of ActiveX control installation prompts for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, prompting for ActiveX control installations will be blocked for Internet Explorer processes. |
| Windows Components / Internet Explorer / Security Features / Restrict File Download | Internet Explorer Processes | Enabled | This policy setting enables blocking of file download prompts that are not user initiated. If you enable this policy setting, file download prompts that are not user initiated will be blocked for Internet Explorer processes. |
| Windows Components / Internet Explorer / Security Features / Scripted Window Security Restrictions | Internet Explorer Processes | Enabled | Internet Explorer allows scripts to programmatically open, resize, and reposition windows of various types. The Window Restrictions security feature restricts popup windows and prohibits scripts from displaying windows in which the title and status bars are not visible to the user or obfuscate other Windows' title and status bars. If you enable this policy setting, popup windows and other restrictions apply for File Explorer and Internet Explorer processes. |

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can set the Feed Sync Engine to download an enclosure through the Feed property page. A developer can change the download setting through the Feed APIs. |
| Windows Components / Search | Allow indexing of encrypted files | Disabled | This policy setting allows encrypted items to be indexed. if you enable this policy setting, indexing will attempt to decrypt and index the content (access restrictions will still apply). If you disable this policy setting the search service components (including non-Microsoft components) are expected not to index encrypted items or encrypted stores. This policy setting is not configured by default. If you do not configure this policy setting the local setting configured through Control Panel will be used. By default, the Control Panel setting is set to not index encrypted content. When this setting is enabled or disabled the index is rebuilt completely. Full volume encryption (such as BitLocker Drive Encryption or a non-Microsoft solution) must be used for the location of the index to maintain security for encrypted files. |

## Controls

The controls enabled in level 5 enforce a reasonable security level while minimizing the impact to users and applications. 

| Feature                           | Config                              | Description        |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| [Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46899) | Deployed to all devices | Generates a unique local admin password to devices, mitigating many lateral traversal attacks. |
| [Windows Defender ATP EDR](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/overview-endpoint-detection-response)          | Deployed to all devices             | The Windows Defender ATP endpoint detection and response (EDR) provides actionable and near real-time detection of advanced attacks. EDR helps security analysts , and aggregates alerts with the same attack techniques or attributed to the same attacker into an an entity called an *incident*. An incident helps analysts prioritize alerts, collectively investigate the full scope of a breach, and respond to threats. Windows Defender ATP EDR is not expected to impact users or applications, and it can be deployed to all devices in a single step.      |
| [Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard)                 | Enabled for all compatible hardware | Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Windows Defender Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs), and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials. There is a small risk to application compatibility, as [applications will break](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements#application-requirements) if they require NTLMv1, Kerberos DES encryption, Kerberos unconstrained delegation, or extracting the Keberos TGT. As such, Microsoft recommends deploying Credential Guard using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates).  |   
| [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/deploy/)                    | Default browser                     | Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 provides better security than Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). While you may still need to leverage IE11 for compatibility with some sites, Microsoft recommends configuring Microsoft Edge as the default browser, and building an Enterprise Mode Site List to redirect to IE11 only for those sites that require it. Microsoft recommends leveraging either Windows Analytics or Enterprise Site Discovery to build the initial Enterprise Mode Site List, and then gradually deploying this configuration using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates).   |
| [Windows Defender Application Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview) | Enabled on compatible hardware      | Windows Defender Application Guard uses a hardware isolation approach. If an employee goes to an untrusted site through either Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge opens the site in an isolated container, which is separate from the host operating system and enabled by Hyper-V. If the untrusted site turns out to be malicious, the isolated container protects the host PC, and the attacker can't get to your enterprise data. There is a small risk to application compatibility, as some applications may require interaction with the host PC but may not yet be on the list of trusted web sites for Application Guard. Microsoft recommends leveraging either Windows Analytics or Enterprise Site Discovery to build the initial Network Isolation Settings, and then gradually deploying this configuration using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates). |
| [Network protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/network-protection-exploit-guard) | Configure and enforce Network Protection              | Network protection helps to prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet. It expands the scope of Windows Defender SmartScreen to block all outbound HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources (based on the domain or hostname). There is a risk to application compatibility, as a result of false positives in flagged sites. Microsoft recommends deploying using the Audit / Enforce Methodology. |
