# Level 5 enterprise security configuration 

**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10

Level 5 is the minimum security configuration for an enterprise device.
Microsoft recommends the following configuration for level 5 devices.

## Hardware

Devices targeting Level 5 should support the following hardware features:

- [Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-tpm)
- [Bitlocker Drive Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-bitlocker)
- [UEFI Secure Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot)
- Drivers and Firmware Distributed through Windows Update

## Policies

The policies in level 5 enforce a reasonable security level while minimizing the impact to users or to applications. 
Microsoft recommends using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates) for these security configurations and controls, noting that the timeline can generally be short given the limited potential impact of the security controls.

| Password Policy         | Password must meet complexity requirements                                                       | Enabled                                                 | Determines whether passwords must meet complexity requirements:<br>1) Not contain the user's samAccountName (Account Name) value or entire displayName (Full Name value). Neither check is case sensitive.<br>The samAccountName is checked in its entirety only to determine whether it is part of the password. If the samAccountName is less than three characters long, this check is skipped. The displayName is parsed for delimiters: commas, periods, dashes or hyphens, underscores, spaces, pound signs, and tabs. If any of these delimiters are found, the displayName is split and all parsed sections (tokens) are confirmed to not be included in the password. Tokens that are less than three characters are ignored, and substrings of the tokens are not checked. For example, the name "Erin M. Hagens" is split into three tokens: "Erin", "M", and "Hagens". Because the second token is only one character long, it is ignored. Therefore, this user could not have a password that included either "erin" or "hagens" as a substring anywhere in the password.<br>2) Contain characters from three of the following categories:<br>- Uppercase letters of European languages (A through Z, with diacritic marks, Greek and Cyrillic characters)<br>- Lowercase letters of European languages (a through z, sharp-s, with diacritic marks, Greek and Cyrillic characters)<br>-  Base 10 digits (0 through 9)<br>-Non-alphanumeric characters (special characters):<br>(~!@#$%^&*_-+=`\|\\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/)<br>Currency symbols such as the Euro or British Pound are not counted as special characters for this policy setting.<br>- Any Unicode character that is categorized as an alphabetic character but is not uppercase or lowercase. This includes Unicode characters from Asian languages.  |

The controls enabled in level 5 enforce a reasonable security level while minimizing the impact to users and applications.

|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| [Windows Defender ATP EDR](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/overview-endpoint-detection-response)          | Deployed to all devices             | The Windows Defender ATP endpoint detection and response (EDR) provides actionable and near real-time detection of advanced attacks. EDR helps security analysts , and aggregates alerts with the same attack techniques or attributed to the same attacker into an an entity called an *incident*. An incident helps analysts prioritize alerts, collectively investigate the full scope of a breach, and respond to threats. Windows Defender ATP EDR is not expected to impact users or applications, and it can be deployed to all devices in a single step.      |
| [Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard)                 | Enabled for all compatible hardware | Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Windows Defender Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs), and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials. There is a small risk to application compatibility, as [applications will break](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements#application-requirements) if they require NTLMv1, Kerberos DES encryption, Kerberos unconstrained delegation, or extracting the Keberos TGT. As such, Microsoft recommends deploying Credential Guard using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates).  |   
| [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/deploy/)                    | Default browser                     | Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 provides better security than Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). While you may still need to leverage IE11 for compatibility with some sites, Microsoft recommends configuring Microsoft Edge as the default browser, and building an Enterprise Mode Site List to redirect to IE11 only for those sites that require it. Microsoft recommends leveraging either Windows Analytics or Enterprise Site Discovery to build the initial Enterprise Mode Site List, and then gradually deploying this configuration using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates).   |
| [Windows Defender Application Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview) | Enabled on compatible hardware      | Windows Defender Application Guard uses a hardware isolation approach. If an employee goes to an untrusted site through either Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge opens the site in an isolated container, which is separate from the host operating system and enabled by Hyper-V. If the untrusted site turns out to be malicious, the isolated container protects the host PC, and the attacker can't get to your enterprise data. There is a small risk to application compatibility, as some applications may require interaction with the host PC but may not yet be on the list of trusted web sites for Application Guard. Microsoft recommends leveraging either Windows Analytics or Enterprise Site Discovery to build the initial Network Isolation Settings, and then gradually deploying this configuration using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates). |    

## Behaviors

The behaviors recommended in level 5 enforce a reasonable security level while minimizing the impact to users or to applications.

| Feature | Config            | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| OS security updates | Deploy Windows Quality Updates within 7 days of release | As the time between the release of a patch and an exploit based on the reverse engineering of that patch continues to shrink, a critical aspect of security hygiene is having an engineering process that quickly validates and deploys Quality Updates that address security vulnerabilities. |
