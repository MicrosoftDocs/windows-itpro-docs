# Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously

**Applies to**
-   Windows 11
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously** security policy setting.

## Reference

This policy setting determines which shared folders can be accessed by anonymous users.

### Possible values

-   User-defined list of shared folders
-   Not Defined

### Best practices

-   Set this policy to a null value. There should be little impact because this null value is the default one. All users will have to be authenticated before they can access shared resources on the server.

### Location

Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options

### Default values

The following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.

| Server type or GPO | Default value |
| - | - |
| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| 
| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| 
| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Not defined| 
| DC Effective Default Settings | Not defined| 
| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Not defined| 
| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Not defined| 
 
## Policy management

This section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.

### Restart requirement

None. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they're saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

Any shared folders that are listed can be accessed by any network user, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data.

### Countermeasure

Configure the **Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously** setting to a null value.

### Potential impact

There should be little impact because this state is the default configuration. Only authenticated users have access to shared resources on the server.
