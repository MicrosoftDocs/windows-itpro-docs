# Account lockout duration

**Applies to**
-   Windows 11
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, and security considerations for the **Account lockout duration** security policy setting.

## Reference

The **Account lockout duration** policy setting determines the number of minutes that a locked-out account remains locked out before automatically becoming unlocked. The available range is from 1 through 99,999 minutes. A value of 0 specifies that the account will be locked out until an administrator explicitly unlocks it. If **Account lockout threshold** is set to a number greater than zero, **Account lockout duration** must be greater than or equal to the value of [Reset account lockout counter after](reset-account-lockout-counter-after.md).
This policy setting is dependent on the **Account lockout threshold** policy setting that is defined, and it must be greater than or equal to the value specified for the [Reset account lockout counter after](reset-account-lockout-counter-after.md) policy setting.

### Possible values

-   A user-defined number of minutes from 0 through 99,999
-   Not defined

If [Account lockout threshold](account-lockout-threshold.md) is configured, after the specified number of failed attempts, the account will be locked out. If the **Account lockout duration** is set to 0, the account will remain locked until an administrator unlocks it manually.

It's advisable to set **Account lockout duration** to approximately 15 minutes. To specify that the account will never be locked out, set the **Account lockout threshold** value to 0. 

### Location

### Default values

The following table lists the actual and effective default policy values. Default values are also listed on the policy's property page.

| Server type or Group Policy Object (GPO) | Default value |
| - | - |
| Default domain policy | Not defined |
| Default domain controller policy | Not defined |
| Stand-alone server default settings | Not applicable |
| Domain controller effective default settings | Not defined |
| Member server effective default settings | Not defined |
| Client computer effective default settings | Not applicable |
 
## Security considerations

More than a few unsuccessful password submissions during an attempt to sign in to a computer might represent an attacker's attempts to determine an account password by trial and error. The Windows and Windows Server operating systems can track sign-in attempts, and you can configure the operating system to disable the account for a preset period of time after a specified number of failed attempts. Account lockout policy settings control the threshold for this response and what action to take after the threshold is reached.

### Vulnerability

A denial-of-service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the [Account lockout threshold](account-lockout-threshold.md) policy setting and repeatedly attempts to sign in with a specific account. After you configure the Account lockout threshold policy setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number of failed attempts. If you configure the **Account lockout duration** policy setting to 0, the account remains locked until you unlock it manually.

### Countermeasure

Configure the **Account lockout duration** policy setting to an appropriate value for your environment. To specify that the account will remain locked until you manually unlock it, configure the value to 0. When the **Account lockout duration** policy setting is configured to a nonzero value, automated attempts to guess account passwords are delayed for this interval before resuming attempts against a specific account. Using this setting in combination with the [Account lockout threshold](account-lockout-threshold.md) policy setting makes automated password guessing attempts more difficult.

### Potential impact

Configuring the **Account lockout duration** policy setting to 0 so that accounts can't be automatically unlocked can increase the number of requests that your organization's Help Desk receives to unlock accounts that were locked by mistake.
