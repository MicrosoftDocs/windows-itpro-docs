# Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in

**Applies to**
-   Windows 11
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, and security considerations for the **Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in** security policy setting. Before Windows 10 version 1703, this policy setting was named **Interactive logon:Do not display last user name.**

## Reference

This security policy setting determines whether the name of the last user to sign in to the device is displayed on the Secure Desktop.

If this policy is enabled, the full name of the last user to successfully sign in isn't displayed on the Secure Desktop, nor is the user’s sign-in tile displayed. Additionally, if the **Switch user** feature is used, the full name and sign-in tile aren't displayed. The sign-in screen requests a qualified domain account name (or local user name) and password.

If this policy is disabled, the full name of the last user to sign in is displayed, and the user’s sign-in tile is displayed. This behavior is the same when the **Switch user** feature is used.

### Possible values

-   Enabled
-   Disabled
-   Not defined

### Best practices

Your implementation of this policy depends on your security requirements for displayed sign-in information. If you have devices that store sensitive data, with monitors displayed in unsecured locations, or if you have devices with sensitive data that are remotely accessed, revealing logged on user’s full names or domain account names might contradict your overall security policy.

### Location

Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options

### Default values

| Server type or Group Policy object (GPO) | Default value|
| - | - |
| Default domain policy| Disabled|
| Default domain controller policy| Disabled|
| Stand-alone server default settings | Disabled|
| Domain controller effective default settings | Disabled|
| Member server effective default settings | Disabled|
| Effective GPO default settings on client computers | Disabled|
 
## Policy management

This section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.

### Restart requirement

None. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they're saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.

### Policy conflict considerations

None.

### Group Policy

This policy setting can be configured by using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to be distributed through Group Policy Objects (GPOs). If this policy isn't contained in a distributed GPO, this policy can be configured on the local computer by using the Local Security Policy snap-in.

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or someone who can connect to the device through Remote Desktop Session Host) could view the name of the last user who logged on. The attacker could then try to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try to sign in.

### Countermeasure

Enable the **Interactive logon: Do not display last user name** setting.

### Potential impact

Users must always type their user names and passwords when they sign in locally or to the domain. The sign-in tiles of all logged on users aren't displayed.
