# Kerberos Policy

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

Describes the Kerberos Policy settings and provides links to policy setting descriptions.

The Kerberos version 5 authentication protocol provides the default mechanism for authentication services and the authorization data necessary for a user to access a resource and perform a task on that resource. By reducing the lifetime of Kerberos tickets, you reduce the risk of a legitimate user's credentials being stolen and successfully used by an attacker. However, this ticket lifetime reduction also increases the authorization overhead. In most environments, these settings shouldn't need to be changed.

These policy settings are located in **\\Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Kerberos Policy**.

The following topics provide a discussion of implementation and best practices considerations, policy location, default values for the server type or GPO, relevant differences in operating system versions, security considerations (including the possible settings vulnerabilities of each setting), 
countermeasures you can take, and the potential impact for each setting.
