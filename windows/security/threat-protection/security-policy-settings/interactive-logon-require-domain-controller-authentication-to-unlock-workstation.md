# Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the **Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation** security policy setting.

## Reference

Unlocking a locked device requires sign-in information. For domain accounts, the **Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation** policy setting determines whether it's necessary to contact a domain controller to unlock a device. Enabling this policy setting requires a domain controller to authenticate the domain account that is being used to unlock the device. Disabling this policy setting allows a user to unlock the device without the computer verifying the sign-in information with a domain controller. However, if [Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)](interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available.md) is set to a value greater than zero, the user's cached credentials will be used to unlock the system.

The device caches (locally in memory) the credentials of any users who have been authenticated. The device uses these cached credentials to authenticate anyone who attempts to unlock the console.

When cached credentials are used, any changes that have recently been made to the account (such as user rights assignments, account lockout, or the account being disabled) aren't considered or applied after this authentication process. This result means not only that user rights aren't updated, but more importantly that disabled accounts are still able to unlock the console of the system.

It's advisable to set **Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation** to Enabled and set [Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)](interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available.md) to 0. When the console of a device is locked by a user or automatically by a screen saver time-out, the console can only be unlocked if the user is able to reauthenticate to the domain controller. If no domain controller is available, users can't unlock their devices.

### Possible values

-   Enabled
-   Disabled
-   Not defined

### Best practices

-   Set **Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation** to Enabled and set [Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)](interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available.md) to 0. When the console of a device is locked by a user or automatically by a screen saver time-out, the console can only be unlocked if the user is able to reauthenticate to the domain controller. If no domain controller is available, users can't unlock their devices.

### Location

Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options

### Default values

The following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.

| Server type or GPO | Default value |
| - | - |
| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| 
| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| 
| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| 
| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled| 
| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| 
| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| 
 
## Policy management

This section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.

### Restart requirement

None. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they're saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.

### Policy conflict considerations

None

### Group Policy

This policy setting can be configured by using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to be distributed through Group Policy Objects (GPOs). If this policy isn't contained in a distributed GPO, this policy can be configured on the local computer by using the Local Security Policy snap-in.

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

By default, the device caches locally in memory the credentials of any users who are authenticated. The device uses these cached credentials to authenticate anyone who attempts to unlock the console. When cached credentials are used, any changes that have recently been made to the account—such as user rights assignments, account lockout, or the account being disabled—aren't considered or applied after the account is authenticated. User privileges aren't updated, and disabled accounts are still able to unlock the console of the device

### Countermeasure

Configure the **Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation** setting to Enabled and configure the [Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)](interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available.md) setting to 0.

### Potential impact

When the console on a device is locked by a user or automatically by a screen-saver timeout, the console can be unlocked only if the user can reauthenticate to the domain controller. If no domain controller is available, users can't unlock their workstations. If you configure the [Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)](interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available.md) setting to 0, users whose domain controllers are unavailable (such as mobile or remote users) can't sign in.
