# Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts

**Applies to**
-   Windows 11
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, management, and security considerations for the **Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts** security policy setting.

## Reference

This setting prevents using the **Settings** app to add a Microsoft account for single sign-on (SSO) authentication for Microsoft services and some background services, or using a Microsoft account for single sign-on to other applications or services. For more information, see [Microsoft Accounts](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-microsoft-accounts).

There are two options if this setting is enabled:

- **Users can’t add Microsoft accounts** means that existing connected accounts can still sign in to the device (and appear on the sign-in screen). However, users can't use the **Settings** app to add new connected accounts (or connect local accounts to Microsoft accounts).

- **Users can’t add or log on with Microsoft accounts** means that users can't add new connected accounts (or connect local accounts to Microsoft accounts) or use existing connected accounts through **Settings**.

If you disable or don't configure this policy (recommended), users will be able to use Microsoft accounts with Windows.

### Possible values
-   This policy is disabled
-   Users can’t add Microsoft accounts
-   Users can’t add or sign in with Microsoft accounts

By default, this setting isn't defined on domain controllers and disabled on stand-alone servers.

### Best practices

-   If this policy setting is disabled or isn't configured on the client computer, users will be able to use their Microsoft account, local account, or domain account for their sign-in session to Windows. It also enables the user to connect a local or domain account to a Microsoft account. This ability to connect provides a convenient option for your users.
-   If you need to limit the use of Microsoft accounts in your organization, click the **Users can’t add Microsoft accounts** setting option so that users won't be able to use the **Settings** app to add new connected accounts.

### Location

Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options

## Policy management

This section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.

### Restart requirement

None. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they're saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of the countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

Although Microsoft accounts are password-protected, they also have the potential of greater exposure outside of the enterprise. Additionally, if the owner of a Microsoft account isn't easily distinguishable, auditing and forensics become more difficult.

### Countermeasure

Require only domain accounts in your enterprise by limiting the use of Microsoft accounts. Click the **Users can’t add Microsoft accounts** setting option so that users won't be able to create new Microsoft accounts on a device, switch a local account to a Microsoft account, or connect a domain account to a Microsoft account.

### Potential impact

Establishing greater control over accounts in your organization can give you more secure management capabilities, including procedures around password resets.
