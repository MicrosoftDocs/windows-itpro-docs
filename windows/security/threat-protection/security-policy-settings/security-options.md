# Security Options

**Applies to**
-   WindowsÂ 10

Provides an introduction to the **Security Options** settings for local security policies and links to more information.

The **Security Options** contain the following groupings of security policy settings that allow you to configure the behavior of the local computer. Some of these policies can be included in a Group Policy Object and distributed over your organization.

When you edit policy settings locally on a device, you only affect the settings on only that device. If you configure the settings in a Group Policy Object (GPO), the settings apply to all devices that are subject to that GPO.

For info about setting security policies, see [Configure security policy settings](how-to-configure-security-policy-settings.md).
