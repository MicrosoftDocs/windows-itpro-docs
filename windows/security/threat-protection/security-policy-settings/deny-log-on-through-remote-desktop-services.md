# Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services

**Applies to**
-   Windows 11
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** security policy setting.

## Reference

This policy setting determines which users are prevented from logging on to the device through a Remote Desktop connection through Remote Desktop Services. It's possible for a user to establish a Remote Desktop connection to a particular server, but not be able to sign in to the console of that server.

Constant: SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight

### Possible values

-   User-defined list of accounts
-   Not defined

### Best practices

-   To control who can open a Remote Desktop connection and sign in to the device, add the user account to or remove user accounts from the Remote Desktop Users group.

### Location

Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Assignment

### Default values

The following table lists the actual and effective default policy values for the most recent supported versions of Windows. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.

| Server type or GPO | Default value |
| - | - |
| Default Domain Policy | Not defined |
| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| 
| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Not defined| 
| Domain Controller Effective Default Settings | Not defined| 
| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Not defined| 
| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Not defined| 
 
## Policy management

This section describes features, tools, and guidance to help you manage this policy.

A restart of the computer isn't required for this policy setting to be effective.

Any change to the user rights assignment for an account becomes effective the next time the owner of the account logs on.

The **Remote System** property controls settings for Remote Desktop Services (**Allow or prevent remote connections to the computer**) and for Remote Assistance (**Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer**).

### Group Policy

This policy setting supersedes the [Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services](allow-log-on-through-remote-desktop-services.md) policy setting if a user account is subject to both policies.

Group Policy settings are applied in the following order. They overwrite settings on the local device at the next Group Policy update.

1.  Local policy settings
2.  Site policy settings
3.  Domain policy settings
4.  Organizational unit policy settings

When a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting.

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

Any account with the right to sign in through Remote Desktop Services could be used to sign in to the remote console of the device. If this user right isn't restricted to legitimate users who need to sign in to the console of the computer, malicious users might download and run software that elevates their user rights.

### Countermeasure

Assign the **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** user right to the built-in local guest account and all service accounts. If you have installed optional components, such as ASP.NET, you may want to assign this user right to other accounts that are required by those components.

### Potential impact

If you assign the **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** user right to other groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. Accounts that have this user right can't connect to the device through Remote Desktop Services or Remote Assistance. You should confirm that delegated tasks aren't negatively affected.
