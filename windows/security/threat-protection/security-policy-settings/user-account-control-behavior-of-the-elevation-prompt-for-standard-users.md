# User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users** security policy setting.

## Reference

This policy setting determines the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users.

### Possible values

-   **Automatically deny elevation requests**

    This option returns an “Access denied” error message to standard users when they try to perform an operation that requires elevation of privilege. Most organizations that run desktops as standard users configure this policy to reduce Help Desk calls.

-   **Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop**

    This prompt for credentials is the default. When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to enter a different user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

-   **Prompt for credentials**

    An operation that requires elevation of privilege prompts the user to type an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

### Best practices

1.  Configure the **User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users** to **Automatically deny elevation requests**. This setting requires the user to sign in with an administrative account to run programs that require elevation of privilege.
2.  As a security best practice, standard users shouldn't have knowledge of administrative passwords. However, if your users have both standard and administrator-level accounts, set **Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop** so that the users don't choose to always sign in with their administrator accounts, and they shift their behavior to use the standard user account.

### Default values

The following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.

| Server type or GPO | Default value |
| - | - |
| Default Domain Policy | Not defined| 
| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined|

| DC Effective Default Settings | Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop| 
| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop| 
| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop| 
 
## Policy management

This section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.

### Restart requirement

None. Changes to this policy become effective without a computer restart when they're saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.

### Group Policy

All auditing capabilities are integrated in Group Policy. You can configure, deploy, and manage these settings in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or Local Security Policy snap-in for a domain, site, or organizational unit (OU).

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

One of the risks that the UAC feature tries to mitigate is that of malicious programs running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of their activity. This setting raises awareness to the user that a program requires the use of elevated privilege operations, and it requires that the user supply administrative credentials for the program to run.

### Countermeasure

Configure the **User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users** to **Automatically deny elevation requests**. This setting requires the user to sign in with an administrative account to run programs that require elevation of privilege. As a security best practice, standard users shouldn't have knowledge of administrative passwords. However, if your users have both standard and administrator-level accounts, we recommend setting **Prompt for credentials** so that the users don't choose to always sign in with their administrator accounts, and they shift their behavior to use the standard user account.

### Potential impact

Users must provide administrative passwords to run programs with elevated privileges. This impact could cause an increased load on IT staff while the programs that are affected are identified and standard operating procedures are modified to support least privilege operations.
