# Configure Microsoft Defender Application Guard policy settings

[!INCLUDE [mdag-edge-deprecation-notice](../../../includes/mdag-edge-deprecation-notice.md)]

Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Application Guard) works with Group Policy to help you manage your organization's computer settings. By using Group Policy, you can configure a setting once, and then copy it onto many computers. For example, you can set up multiple security settings in a Group Policy Object, which is linked to a domain, and then apply all those settings to every endpoint in the domain.

Application Guard uses both network isolation and application-specific settings.

For more information about Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG) for Microsoft Edge in stand-alone mode, see [Microsoft Defender Application Guard overview](md-app-guard-overview.md).

## Network isolation settings

These settings, located at `Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Network Isolation`, help you define and manage your organization's network boundaries. Application Guard uses this information to automatically transfer any requests to access the noncorporate resources into the Application Guard container.

> [!NOTE]
> For Windows 10, if you have KB5014666 installed, and for Windows 11, if you have KB5014668 installed, you don't need to configure network isolation policy to enable Application Guard for Microsoft Edge in managed mode.

> [!NOTE]
> You must configure either the Enterprise resource domains hosted in the cloud or Private network ranges for apps settings on your employee devices to successfully turn on Application Guard using enterprise mode. Proxy servers must be a neutral resource listed in the **Domains categorized as both work and personal** policy.

|Policy name|Supported versions|Description|
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
|Private network ranges for apps | At least Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or Windows RT| A comma-separated list of IP address ranges that are in your corporate network. Included endpoints or endpoints that are included within a specified IP address range, are rendered using Microsoft Edge and won't be accessible from the Application Guard environment.|
|Enterprise resource domains hosted in the cloud| At least Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or Windows RT|A pipe-separated (`|`) list of your domain cloud resources. Included endpoints are rendered using Microsoft Edge and won't be accessible from the Application Guard environment. <p>This list supports the wildcards detailed in the [Network isolation settings wildcards](#network-isolation-settings-wildcards) table.|
|Domains categorized as both work and personal| At least Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or Windows RT|A comma-separated list of domain names used as both work or personal resources. Included endpoints are rendered using Microsoft Edge and will be accessible from the Application Guard and regular Microsoft Edge environment. <p>This list supports the wildcards detailed in the [Network isolation settings wildcards](#network-isolation-settings-wildcards) table.|

## Network isolation settings wildcards

|Value|Number of dots to the left|Meaning|
|-----|--------------------------|-------|
|`contoso.com`|0|Trust only the literal value of `contoso.com`.|
|`www.contoso.com`|0|Trust only the literal value of `www.contoso.com`.|
|`.contoso.com`|1|Trust any domain that ends with the text `contoso.com`. Matching sites include `spearphishingcontoso.com`, `contoso.com`, and `www.contoso.com`.|
|`..contoso.com`|2|Trust all levels of the domain hierarchy that are to the left of the dot. Matching sites include `shop.contoso.com`, `us.shop.contoso.com`, `www.us.shop.contoso.com`, but NOT `contoso.com` itself.|

## Application-specific settings
