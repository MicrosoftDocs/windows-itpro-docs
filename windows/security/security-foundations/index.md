# Windows security foundations

Microsoft is committed to continuously invest in improving our software development process, building highly secure-by-design software, and addressing security compliance requirements. At Microsoft, we embed security and privacy considerations from the earliest life-cycle phases of all our software development processes. We build in security from the ground for powerful defense in today's threat environment.

Our strong security foundation uses Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) Bug Bounty, support for product security standards and certifications, and Azure Code signing. As a result, we improve security by producing software with fewer defects and vulnerabilities instead of relying on applying updates after vulnerabilities have been identified.
