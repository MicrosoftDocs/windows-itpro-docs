# Virus and threat protection

The **Virus & threat protection** section contains information and settings for antivirus protection from Microsoft Defender Antivirus and third-party antivirus products. These settings include Controlled folder access settings to prevent unknown apps from changing files in protected folders, plus Microsoft OneDrive configuration to help you recover from a ransomware attack. This area also notifies users and provides recovery instructions if there's a ransomware attack.

You can hide the **Virus & threat protection** section or the **Ransomware protection** area from users of the machine. This option can be useful if you don't want users in your organization to see or have access to user-configured options for these features.

## Hide the Virus & threat protection section

You can choose to hide the entire section by using Group Policy. The section won't appear on the home page of **Windows Security**, and its icon won't be shown on the navigation bar on the side.

This section can be hidden only by using Group Policy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have Windows 10, version 1709 or later. The ADMX/ADML template files for earlier versions of Windows do not include these Group Policy settings.

1. On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)). Right-click the Group Policy Object (GPO) you want to configure and select **Edit**.
1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, go to **Computer configuration** and select **Administrative templates**.
1. Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Security > Virus and threat protection**.
1. Open the **Hide the Virus and threat protection area** setting and set it to **Enabled**. Select **OK**.
1. [Deploy](/windows/win32/srvnodes/group-policy) the updated GPO as you normally do.

> [!NOTE]
> If you hide all sections then **Windows Security** will show a restricted interface, as in the following screenshot:
