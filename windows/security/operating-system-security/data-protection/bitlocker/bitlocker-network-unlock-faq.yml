          BitLocker Network Unlock FAQ
        answer: |  
          BitLocker Network Unlock enables easier management for BitLocker-enabled desktops and servers that use the TPM+PIN protection method in a domain environment. When a computer that is connected to a wired corporate network is rebooted, Network Unlock allows the PIN entry prompt to be bypassed. It automatically unlocks BitLocker-protected operating system volumes by using a trusted key that is provided by the Windows Deployment Services server as its secondary authentication method.
          
          To use Network Unlock, a PIN must be configured for the computer. When the computer isn't connected to the network, a PIN will need to be provided to unlock it.
          
          BitLocker Network Unlock has software and hardware requirements for both client computers, Windows Deployment services, and domain controllers that must be met before it can be used.
          
          Network Unlock uses two protectors - the TPM protector and the protector provided by the network or by the PIN. Automatic unlock uses a single protector - the one stored in the TPM. If the computer is joined to a network without the key protector, it will prompt to enter a PIN. If the PIN isn't available, the recovery key will need to be used to unlock the computer if it can't be connected to the network.
