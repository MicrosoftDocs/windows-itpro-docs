title: BitLocker frequently asked questions (FAQ) resources
summary: This article links to frequently asked questions about BitLocker. BitLocker is a data protection feature that encrypts drives on computers to help prevent data theft or exposure. BitLocker-protected computers can also delete data more securely when they're decommissioned because it's much more difficult to recover deleted data from an encrypted drive than from a non-encrypted drive.
