# System Guard Secure Launch and SMM protection

This article explains how to configure [System Guard Secure Launch and System Management Mode (SMM) protection](how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows.md) to improve the startup security of Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. The information below is presented from a client perspective.

> [!NOTE]
> System Guard Secure Launch feature requires a supported processor. For more information, see [System requirements for System Guard](how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows.md#system-requirements-for-system-guard).

## How to enable System Guard Secure Launch

You can enable System Guard Secure Launch by using any of these options:

- [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](#mobile-device-management)
- [Group Policy](#group-policy)
- [Windows Security settings](#windows-security)
- [Registry](#registry)

### Mobile Device Management

System Guard Secure Launch can be configured for Mobile Device Management (MDM) by using DeviceGuard policies in the Policy CSP, [DeviceGuard/ConfigureSystemGuardLaunch](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deviceguard#deviceguard-configuresystemguardlaunch).

### Group Policy

1. Select **Start** > type and then select **Edit group policy**.
1. Select **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Device Guard** > **Turn On Virtualization Based Security** > **Secure Launch Configuration**.
