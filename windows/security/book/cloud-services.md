Today's workforce has more freedom and mobility than ever before, but the risk of data exposure is also at its highest. At Microsoft, we are focused on getting customers to the cloud to benefit from modern hybrid workstyles while improving security management. Built on Zero Trust principles, Windows 11 works with Microsoft cloud services to safeguard sensitive information while controlling access and mitigating threats.

From identity and device management to Office apps and data storage, Windows 11 and integrated cloud services can help improve productivity, security, and resilience anywhere.
