[Privacy: Your data, powering your experiences, controlled by you](https://privacy.microsoft.com/)[.](https://privacy.microsoft.com/) Privacy is becoming top of mind for customers, who want to know who is using their data and why. They also need to know how to control and manage the data that is being collected—so providing transparency and control over this personal data is essential. At Microsoft we are focused on protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your data and will only use it in a way that is consistent with your expectations.
