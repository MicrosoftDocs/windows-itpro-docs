# Network security

:::image type="content" source="images/operating-system.png" alt-text="Diagram of containing a list of security features." lightbox="images/operating-system.png" border="false":::

Windows 11 raises the bar for network security, offering comprehensive protection to help people work with confidence from almost anywhere. To help reduce an organization's attack
surface, network protection in Windows prevents people from accessing dangerous IP addresses and domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content.
Using reputation-based services, network protection blocks access to potentially harmful, low-reputation domains and IP addresses.

New DNS and TLS protocol versions strengthen the end-to-end protections needed for applications, web services, and Zero Trust networking. File access adds an untrusted network scenario with Server Message Block over QUIC, as well as new encryption and signing capabilities. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth advancements also provide greater trust in connections to other devices. In addition, VPN and Windows Firewall (previously called Windows Defender Firewall) platforms offer new ways to easily configure and debug software.

In enterprise environments, network protection works best with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, which provides detailed reporting on protection events as part of larger investigation scenarios.

## Transport layer security (TLS)

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the internet's most deployed security protocol, encrypting data in transit to provide a secure communication channel between two endpoints. Windows defaults to the latest protocol versions and strong cipher suites unless policies are in effect to limit them. There are many extensions available, such as client authentication for enhanced server security and session resumption for improved application performance.

TLS 1.3 is the latest version of the protocol and is enabled by default starting with Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022. TLS 1.3 eliminates obsolete cryptographic algorithms, enhances security over older versions, and encrypts as much of the TLS handshake as possible. The handshake is more performant, with one fewer round trip per connection on average, and supports only five strong cipher suites, which provide perfect forward secrecy and reduced operational risk.

Customers using TLS 1.3 (or Windows components that support it, including HTTP.SYS, WinInet, .NET, MsQuic, and more) will get enhanced privacy and lower latencies for their encrypted online connections. Note that if either the client or server does not support TLS 1.3, Windows will fall back to TLS 1.2.

Legacy protocol versions TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are officially deprecated and will be disabled by default in future OS versions only. This change will come to Windows Insider Preview in September 2023. Organizations and application developers are strongly encouraged to begin to identify and remove code dependencies on TLS 1.0/1.1 if they have not done so already.

## DNS security

In Windows 11, the Windows DNS client supports DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS, two encrypted DNS protocols. These allow administrators to ensure their devices protect their
name queries from on-path attackers, whether they are passive observers logging browsing behavior or active attackers trying to redirect clients to malicious sites. In a Zero Trust
model where no trust is placed in a network boundary, having a secure connection to a trusted name resolver is required.

Windows 11 provides Group Policy as well as programmatic controls to configure DNS over HTTPS behavior. As a result, IT administrators can extend existing security to adopt new models such as Zero Trust. IT administrators can mandate DNS over HTTPS protocol, ensuring that devices that use insecure DNS will fail to connect to network resources. IT administrators also have the option not to use DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS for legacy deployments where network edge appliances are trusted to inspect plain-text DNS traffic. By default, Windows 11 will defer to the local administrator on which resolvers should use encrypted DNS.

Support for DNS encryption integrates with existing Windows DNS configurations such as the Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) and the system Hosts file, as well as resolvers specified per network adapter or network profile. The integration helps Windows 11 ensure that the benefits of greater DNS security do not regress existing DNS control mechanisms.

## Bluetooth protection

The number of Bluetooth devices connected to Windows 11 continues to increase. Windows users connect their Bluetooth headsets, mice, keyboards, and other accessories and improve their day-to-day PC experience by enjoying streaming, productivity, and gaming. Windows supports all standard Bluetooth pairing protocols, including classic and LE Secure connections, secure simple pairing, and classic and LE legacy pairing. Windows also implements host-based LE privacy. Windows updates help users stay current with OS and driver security features in accordance with the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and Standard Vulnerability Reports, as well as issues beyond those required by the Bluetooth core industry standards. Microsoft strongly recommends that Bluetooth accessories' firmware and software are kept up to date.

IT-managed environments have a number of [Bluetooth policies](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-bluetooth) (MDM, Group Policy, and PowerShell) that can be managed through MDM tools such as Microsoft Intune<sup>[\[9\]](conclusion.md#footnote9)</sup>. You can configure Windows to use Bluetooth technology while supporting the security needs of your organization. For example, you can allow input and audio while blocking file transfer, force encryption standards, limit Windows discoverability, or even disable Bluetooth entirely for the most sensitive environments.

## Securing Wi-Fi connections

Windows Wi-Fi supports industry-standard authentication and encryption methods when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a security standard defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) to provide sophisticated data encryption and better user authentication.

The current security standard for Wi-Fi authentication is WPA3, which provides a more secure and reliable connection method as compared to WPA2 and older security protocols. Windows supports three WPA3 modes - WPA3 Personal, WPA3 Enterprise, and WPA3 Enterprise 192-bit Suite B.

Windows 11 includes WPA3 Personal with the new H2E protocol and WPA3 Enterprise 192-bit Suite B. Windows 11 also supports WPA3 Enterprise, which includes enhanced server certificate validation and TLS 1.3 for authentication using EAP-TLS authentication.

Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), a technology that allows wireless devices to establish encrypted connections to public Wi-Fi hotspots, is also included.

## 5G and eSIM

5G networks use stronger encryption and better network segmentation compared to previous generations of cellular protocols. Unlike Wi-Fi, 5G access is always mutually authenticated. Access credentials are stored in an EAL4-certified eSIM that is physically embedded in the device, making it much harder for attackers to tamper with. Together, 5G and eSIM provide a strong foundation for security.

## Windows Firewall

Windows Firewall with Advanced Security (previously called Windows Defender Firewall) is an important part of a layered security model. It provides host-based, two-way network traffic
filtering, blocking unauthorized traffic flowing into or out of the local device based on the types of networks the device is connected to.

Windows Firewall in Windows 11 offers the following benefits:

- Reduces the risk of network security threats: Windows Firewall reduces the attack surface of a device with rules that restrict or allow traffic by many properties, such as IP addresses,
ports, or program paths. This functionality increases manageability and decreases the likelihood of a successful attack
- Safeguards sensitive data and intellectual property: By integrating with Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), Windows Firewall provides a simple way to enforce authenticated, end-to-end network communications. It provides scalable, tiered access to trusted network resources, helping to enforce integrity of the data, and optionally helping to protect the confidentiality of the data
- Extends the value of existing investments: Because Windows Firewall is a host-based firewall that is included with the operating system, there is no additional hardware or software required. Windows Firewall is also designed to complement existing non-Microsoft network security solutions through a documented application programming interface (API)

Windows 11 makes the Windows Firewall easier to analyze and debug. IPSec behavior has been integrated with Packet Monitor (pktmon), an in-box, cross-component network diagnostic tool for Windows. Additionally, the Windows Firewall event logs have been enhanced to ensure an audit can identify the specific filter that was responsible for any given event. This enables analysis of firewall behavior and rich packet capture without relying on third-party tools.

Admins can now configure additional settings through the Firewall and Firewall Rule policy templates in the Endpoint Security node in Microsoft Intune<sup>[\[9\]](conclusion.md#footnote9)</sup>, leveraging the platform
support from the Firewall configuration service provider (CSP) and applying these settings to Windows endpoints.

## Virtual private networks (VPN)

Organizations have long relied on Windows to provide reliable, secured, and manageable virtual private network (VPN) solutions. The Windows VPN client platform includes built-in VPN
protocols, configuration support, a common VPN user interface, and programming support for custom VPN protocols. VPN apps are available in the Microsoft Store for both enterprise and
consumer VPNs, including apps for the most popular enterprise VPN gateways.

In Windows 11, we've integrated the most commonly used VPN controls right into the Windows 11 Quick Actions pane. From the Quick Actions pane, users can see the status of their VPN, start and stop the VPN tunnels, and with one click, go to the modern Settings app for more control.

The Windows VPN platform connects to Microsoft Entra ID<sup>[\[9\]](conclusion.md#footnote9)</sup> and Conditional Access for single sign-on, including multifactor authentication (MFA) through Microsoft Entra ID. The VPN platform also supports classic domain-joined authentication. It's supported by Microsoft Intune and other modern device management (MDM) providers. The flexible VPN profile supports both built-in protocols and custom protocols. It can configure multiple authentication methods and can be automatically started as needed or manually started by the end user. It also supports split-tunnel VPN and exclusive VPN with exceptions for trusted external sites.

With Universal Windows Platform (UWP) VPN apps, end users never get stuck on an old version of their VPN client. VPN apps from the store will be automatically updated as needed. Naturally, the updates are in the control of your IT admins.

The Windows VPN platform has been tuned and hardened for cloud-based VPN providers like Azure VPN. Features like Microsoft Entra ID authentication, Windows user interface integration, plumbing IKE traffic selectors, and server support are all built into the Windows VPN platform. The integration into the Windows VPN platform leads to a simpler IT admin experience. User authentication is more consistent, and users can easily find and control their VPN.

## Server Message Block file services

Server Message Block (SMB) and file services are the most common Windows workloads in the commercial and public sector ecosystem. Users and applications rely on SMB to access the files that run organizations of all sizes. In Windows 11, the SMB protocol has significant security updates to meet today's threats, including AES-256 encryption, accelerated SMB signing, Remote Directory Memory Access (RDMA) network encryption, and an entirely new scenario, SMB over QUIC for untrusted networks.

SMB encryption provides end-to-end encryption of SMB data and protects data from eavesdropping occurrences on internal networks. Windows 11 introduces AES-256-GCM and AES-256-CCM cryptographic suites for SMB 3.1.1 encryption. Windows administrators can mandate the use of this more advanced security or continue to use the more compatible and still-safe AES-128 encryption.

In Windows 11 Enterprise, Education, Pro, and Pro Workstation, SMB Direct now supports encryption. For demanding workloads like video rendering, data science, or extremely large files, you can now operate with the same safety as traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the performance of RDMA. Previously, enabling SMB encryption disabled direct data placement, making RDMA as slow as TCP. Now, data is encrypted before placement, leading to relatively minor performance degradation while adding packet privacy with AES-128 and AES-256 protection.

Windows 11 also introduces AES-128-GMAC for SMB signing. Windows will automatically negotiate this better-performing cipher method when connecting to another computer that supports it. Signing prevents common attacks like relay and spoofing, and it is required by default when clients communicate with Active Directory domain controllers.

Finally, Windows 11 introduces SMB over QUIC, an alternative to the TCP network transport that provides secure, reliable connectivity to edge file servers over untrusted networks like the internet, as well as highly secure communications on internal networks. QUIC is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)-standardized protocol with many benefits when compared with TCP, but most importantly, it always requires TLS 1.3 and encryption. SMB over QUIC offers an SMB VPN for telecommuters, mobile device users, and high-security organizations. All SMB traffic, including authentication and authorization within the tunnel, is never exposed to the underlying network. SMB behaves normally within the QUIC tunnel, meaning the user experience doesn't change. SMB over QUIC will be a game-changing feature for Windows 11 accessing Windows file servers and eventually Azure Files and third parties.

Newly installed Windows 11 Home editions that contain the February 2023 cumulative update no longer install the SMB 1.0 client by default, meaning the Home edition now operates like all other editions of Windows 11. SMB 1.0 is an unsafe and deprecated protocol that Microsoft superseded by later versions of SMB starting with Windows Vista. Microsoft began uninstalling SMB 1.0 by  default in certain Windows 10 editions in 2017. No versions of Windows 11 now install SMB 1.0 by default.
