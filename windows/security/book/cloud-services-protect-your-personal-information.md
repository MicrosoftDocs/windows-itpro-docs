# Protect your personal information

:::image type="content" source="images/cloud-security.png" alt-text="Diagram of containing a list of security features for cloud security." lightbox="images/cloud-security.png" border="false":::

## Microsoft Account

Your Microsoft Account (MSA) gives you access to Microsoft products and services with just one login, allowing you to manage everything all in one place. Keep tabs on your subscriptions and order history, update your privacy and security settings, track the health and safety of your devices, and get rewards. Everything stays with you in the cloud, across devices, and between OS ecosystems, including iOS and Android.

You can even go passwordless with your Microsoft Account by removing the password from your MSA and using the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile Android or iOS phone.

## User reauthentication before password disablement

Windows provides greater flexibility for users to balance ease of use with security. Users can choose the interval that the machine remains idle before it automatically signs the user out. To avoid a security breach and prevent users from accidentally making settings changes, Windows reauthenticates the user before they are allowed to change the setting to not sign out the user even after the device remains idle indefinitely.

This setting is available on the Sign-in options page in Settings and is available on Windows 11 and onward for MSA users worldwide.

## Find my device

When location services and Find my device settings are turned on, basic system services like time zone and Find my device will be allowed to use the device's location. When enabled, Find my device can be used by the admin on the device to help recover lost or stolen Windows devices to reduce security threats that rely on physical access.
