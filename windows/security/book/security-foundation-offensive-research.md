## Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) introduces security best practices, tools, and processes throughout all phases of engineering and development.

## OneFuzz service

A range of tools and techniques - such as threat modeling, static analysis, fuzz testing, and code quality checks - enable continued security value to be embedded into Windows by every engineer on the team from day one. Through the SDL practices, Microsoft engineers are continuously provided with actionable and up-to-date methods to improve development workflows and overall product security before the code has been released.

Microsoft is dedicated to working with the community and our customers to continuously improve and tune our platform and products to help defend against the dynamic and sophisticated threat landscape. Project OneFuzz - an extensible fuzz testing framework used by Microsoft Edge, Windows, and teams across Microsoft - is now available to developers around the world through GitHub as an open-source tool.

## Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering

[Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples?msclkid=1a6280c6c73d11ecab82868efae04e5c) performs targeted design reviews, audits, and deep penetration testing of Windows features using Microsoft's open-source OneFuzz platform as part of their development and testing cycle.

## Windows Insider and Bug Bounty program

As part of our secure development process, the Microsoft Windows Insider Preview bounty program invites eligible researchers across the globe to find and submit vulnerabilities that reproduce in the latest Windows Insider Preview (WIP) Dev Channel.

The goal of the Windows Insider Preview bounty program is to uncover significant vulnerabilities that have a direct and demonstrable impact on the security of customers using the latest version of Windows.

Through this collaboration with researchers across the globe, our teams identify critical vulnerabilities that were not previously found during development and quick fix the issues before releasing our final Windows.
