Cybercriminals can take advantage of poorly secured applications to access valuable resources. With Windows 11, IT admins can combat common application attacks from the moment a device is provisioned. For example, IT can remove local admin rights from user accounts so that PCs run with the least amount of privileges to prevent malicious applications from accessing sensitive resources.

In addition, organizations can control which applications run on their devices with App Control for Business (previously called Windows Defender Application Control - WDAC).
