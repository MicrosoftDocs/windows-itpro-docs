## Privacy dashboard and report

Customers can use the [Microsoft Privacy dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy) to view, export, and delete their information, giving them further transparency and control. They can also use the [Microsoft Privacy Report](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacy-report) to learn more about Windows data collection and how to manage it. For enterprises we provide a guide for Windows Privacy Compliance that includes additional details on the available controls and transparency.

## Privacy transparency and controls

Prominent system tray icons show users when resources and apps like microphones and location are in use. A description of the app and its activity are presented in a simple tooltip that appears when you hover over an icon with your cursor. Apps can also make use of new Windows APIs to support Quick Mute functionality and more.

## Privacy resource usage

Every Microsoft customer should be able to use our products secure in the knowledge that we will protect their privacy and give them the information and tools they need to easily make privacy decisions with confidence. Accessed in Settings, the new app usage history feature gives users a seven-day history of resource access for Location, Camera, Microphone, Phone Calls, Messaging, Contacts, Pictures, Videos, Music library, Screenshots, and other apps.

This information helps you determine if an app is behaving as expected so that you can change the app's access to resources as desired.

## Windows diagnostic data processor configuration

The Windows diagnostic data processor configuration enables the user to be the controller, as defined by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for the Windows diagnostic data collected from Windows devices that meet the configuration requirements.
