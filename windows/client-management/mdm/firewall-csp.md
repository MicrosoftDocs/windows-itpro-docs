# Firewall configuration service provider (CSP)

The table below shows the applicability of Windows:

|Edition|Windows 10|Windows 11|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Home|No|No|
|Pro|Yes|Yes|
|Windows SE|No|Yes|
|Business|Yes|Yes|
|Enterprise|Yes|Yes|
|Education|Yes|Yes|

The Firewall configuration service provider (CSP) allows the mobile device management (MDM) server to configure the Windows Defender Firewall global settings, per profile settings, and the desired set of custom rules to be enforced on the device.  Using the Firewall CSP the IT admin can now manage non-domain devices, and reduce the risk of network security threats across all systems connecting to the corporate network.  This CSP was added Windows 10, version 1709.

Firewall rules in the FirewallRules section must be wrapped in an Atomic block in SyncML, either individually or collectively.

For detailed information on some of the fields below, see [[MS-FASP]: Firewall and Advanced Security Protocol documentation](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-winerrata/6521c5c4-1f76-4003-9ade-5cccfc27c8ac).

The following example shows the Firewall configuration service provider in tree format.

Root node for the Firewall configuration service provider.

<a href="" id="mdmstore"></a>**MdmStore**
Interior node.
Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="global"></a>**MdmStore/Global**
Interior node.
Supported operations are Get.

<a href="" id="policyversionsupported"></a>**MdmStore/Global/PolicyVersionSupported**
Integer value that contains the maximum policy version that the server host can accept. The version number is two octets in size. The lowest-order octet is the minor version; the second-to-lowest octet is the major version. This value isn't merged and is always a fixed value for a particular firewall and advanced security components software build.
Value type in integer. Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="currentprofiles"></a>**MdmStore/Global/CurrentProfiles**
Integer value that contains a bitmask of the current enforced profiles that are maintained by the server firewall host. See <a href="/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fasp/7704e238-174d-4a5e-b809-5f3787dd8acc" data-raw-source="[FW_PROFILE_TYPE](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fasp/7704e238-174d-4a5e-b809-5f3787dd8acc)">FW_PROFILE_TYPE</a> for the bitmasks that are used to identify profile types. This value is available only in the dynamic store; therefore, it's not merged and has no merge law.
Value type in integer. Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="disablestatefulftp"></a>**MdmStore/Global/DisableStatefulFtp**
Boolean value. If false, the firewall performs stateful File Transfer Protocol (FTP) filtering to allow secondary connections. True means stateful FTP is disabled. The merge law for this option is to let "true" values win.
Default value is false.

Data type is bool. Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="saidletime"></a>**MdmStore/Global/SaIdleTime**
This value configures the security association idle time, in seconds. Security associations are deleted after network traffic isn't seen for this specified period of time. The value is integer and MUST be in the range of 300 to 3,600 inclusive. The merge law for this option is to let the value of the GroupPolicyRSoPStore win if it's configured; otherwise, use the local store value.
Default value is 300.
Value type is integer. Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="presharedkeyencoding"></a>**MdmStore/Global/PresharedKeyEncoding**
Specifies the preshared key encoding that is used. The value is integer and MUST be a valid value from the <a href="/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fasp/b9d24a5e-7755-4c60-adeb-e0c7a718f909" data-raw-source="[PRESHARED_KEY_ENCODING_VALUES enumeration](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fasp/b9d24a5e-7755-4c60-adeb-e0c7a718f909)">PRESHARED_KEY_ENCODING_VALUES enumeration</a>. The merge law for this option is to let the value of the GroupPolicyRSoPStore win if it's configured; otherwise, use the local store value.
Default value is 1.
Value type is integer. Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="ipsecexempt"></a>**MdmStore/Global/IPsecExempt**
This value configures IPsec exceptions.

If the maximum value is exceeded when the method RRPC_FWSetGlobalConfig (Opnum 4) is called, the method returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. This error code is returned if no other preceding error is discovered. The merge law for this option is to let the value of the GroupPolicyRSoPStore win if it's configured; otherwise, use the local store value.
Default value is 0.
Value type is integer. Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="crlcheck"></a>**MdmStore/Global/CRLcheck**
This value specifies how certificate revocation list (CRL) verification is enforced. The value is integer and MUST be 0, 1, or 2. The merge law for this option is to let the value of the GroupPolicyRSoPStore win if it's configured; otherwise, use the local store value. Valid valued:

- 0 disables CRL checking
- 1 specifies that CRL checking is attempted and that certificate validation fails only if the certificate is revoked. Other failures that are encountered during CRL checking (such as the revocation URL being unreachable) don't cause certificate validation to fail.
- 2 means that checking is required and that certificate validation fails if any error is encountered during CRL processing

Default value is 0.
Value type is integer. Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="policyversion"></a>**MdmStore/Global/PolicyVersion**

This value identifies a policy configuration option that is supported only on servers that have a schema version of 0x0201.
Value type is string. Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="opportunisticallymatchauthsetperkm"></a>**MdmStore/Global/OpportunisticallyMatchAuthSetPerKM**

For schema versions 0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this value is invalid and MUST NOT be used.
Boolean value. Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="enablepacketqueue"></a>**MdmStore/Global/EnablePacketQueue**
This value specifies how scaling for the software on the receive side is enabled for both the encrypted receive and clear text forward path for the IPsec tunnel gateway scenario. Use of this option also ensures that the packet order is preserved. The data type for this option value is integer and is a combination of flags. Valid values:
