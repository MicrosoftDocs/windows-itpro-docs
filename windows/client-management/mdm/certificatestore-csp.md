# CertificateStore CSP

The table below shows the applicability of Windows:

|Edition|Windows 10|Windows 11|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Home|Yes|Yes|
|Pro|Yes|Yes|
|Business|Yes|Yes|
|Enterprise|Yes|Yes|
|Education|Yes|Yes|

The CertificateStore configuration service provider is used to add secure socket layers (SSL), intermediate, and self-signed certificates.

> [!Note]
> The CertificateStore configuration service provider does not support installing client certificates.
> The Microsoft protocol version of Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) is case insensitive.

For the CertificateStore CSP, you can't use the Replace command unless the node already exists.

The following example shows the CertificateStore configuration service provider management object in tree format as used by both Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA DM) and OMA Client Provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> The device only sends the MDM server expected certificate validation period (ValidPeriodUnits + ValidPeriod) of the SCEP server as part of certificate enrollment request. How this valid period is used to create the certificate depends on the MDM server.

<a href="" id="my-scep-uniqueid-install-enroll"></a>**My/SCEP/*UniqueID*/Install/Enroll**  
Required. Triggers the device to start the certificate enrollment. The MDM server can later query the device to find out whether the new certificate is added. Value type is null, which means that this node doesn't contain a value.

Supported operation is Exec.

<a href="" id="my-wstep-certthumbprint"></a>**My/WSTEP/CertThumbprint**

> [!NOTE]
> The renewal process follows the same steps as device enrollment, which means that it starts with Discovery service, followed by Enrollment policy service, and then Enrollment web service.

Supported operations are Add, Get, Delete, and Replace.

<a href="" id="my-wstep-renew-renewalperiod"></a>**My/WSTEP/Renew/RenewalPeriod**  
Optional. The time (in days) to trigger the client to initiate the MDM client certificate renew process before the MDM certificate expires. The MDM server can't set and update the renewal period. This parameter applies to both manual certificate renewal and request on behalf of (ROBO) certificate renewal. It's recommended that the renew period is set a couple of months before the certificate expires to ensure that the certificate gets renewed successfully with data connectivity.

The default value is 42 and the valid values are 1 – 1000. Value type is an integer.

Supported operations are Add, Get, Delete, and Replace.

> [!NOTE]
> When you set the renewal schedule over SyncML DM commands to ROBOSupport, RenewalPeriod, and RetryInterval, you must wrap them in Atomic commands.

<a href="" id="my-wstep-renew-retryinterval"></a>**My/WSTEP/Renew/RetryInterval**  
Optional. Specifies the retry interval (in days) when the previous renewal failed. It applies to both manual certificate renewal and ROBO automatic certificate renewal. The retry schedule stops at the certificate expiration date.

For ROBO renewal failure, the client retries the renewal periodically until the device reaches the certificate expiration date. This parameter specifies the waiting period for ROBO renewal retries.

For manual retry failure, there are no built-in retries. The user can retry later. At the next scheduled certificate renewal retry period, the device prompts the credential dialog again.

The default value is 7 and the valid values are 1 – 1000 AND =< RenewalPeriod, otherwise it will result in errors. Value type is an integer.

Supported operations are Add, Get, Delete, and Replace.

> [!NOTE]
> When you set the renewal schedule over SyncML DM commands to ROBOSupport, RenewalPeriod, and RetryInterval, you must wrap them in Atomic commands.
