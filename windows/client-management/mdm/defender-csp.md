Tamper protection helps protect important security features from unwanted changes and interference. This protection includes real-time protection, behavior monitoring, and more. Accepts signed string to turn the feature on or off. Settings are configured with an MDM solution, such as Intune and is available in Windows 10 Enterprise E5 or equivalent subscriptions.

The data type is a Signed BLOB.

Supported operations are Add, Delete, Get, Replace.

Intune tamper protection setting UX supports three states:
- Not configured (default): Doesn't have any impact on the default state of the device.
- Enabled: Enables the tamper protection feature.
- Disabled: Turns off the tamper protection feature.

When enabled or disabled exists on the client and admin moves the setting to not configured, it won't have any impact on the device state. To change the state to either enabled or disabled would require to be set explicitly.

<a href="" id="configuration-disablelocaladminmerge"></a>**Configuration/DisableLocalAdminMerge**<br>
This policy setting controls whether or not complex list settings configured by a local administrator are merged with managed settings. This setting applies to lists such as threats and exclusion list.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, unique items defined in preference settings configured by the local administrator will be merged into the resulting effective policy. If conflicts occur, management settings will override preference settings.

If you enable this setting, only items defined by management will be used in the resulting effective policy. Managed settings will override preference settings configured by the local administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Applying this setting won't remove exclusions from the device registry, it will only prevent them from being applied/used. This is reflected in **Get-MpPreference**.

Supported OS versions:  Windows 10

The data type is integer.

Supported operations are Add, Delete, Get, Replace.

Valid values are:
- 1 – Enable.
- 0 (default) – Disable.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, Local Admins will be able to see exclusions in the Windows Security App, in the registry, and via PowerShell.

If you enable this setting, Local Admins will no longer be able to see the exclusion list in the Windows Security app, in the registry, or via PowerShell.
