# ActiveSync CSP

The table below shows the applicability of Windows:

|Edition|Windows 10|Windows 11|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Home|Yes|Yes|
|Pro|Yes|Yes|
|Windows SE|No|Yes|
|Business|Yes|Yes|
|Enterprise|Yes|Yes|
|Education|Yes|Yes|

The ActiveSync configuration service provider is used to set up and change settings for Exchange ActiveSync. After an Exchange account has been updated over-the-air by the ActiveSync configuration service provider, the device must be powered off and then powered back on to see sync status.

Configuring Windows Live ActiveSync accounts through this configuration service provider isn't supported.

> [!NOTE]
> The target user must be logged in for the CSP to succeed. The correct way to configure an account is to use the `./User/Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync` path.

On the desktop, only per user configuration `./User/Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync` is supported. However, the `./Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync` path will work if the user is logged in. The CSP fails when no user is logged in.

The `./Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync path` is deprecated, but will continue to work in the short term.

The following example shows the ActiveSync configuration service provider management objects in tree format as used by Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA DM), OMA Client Provisioning, and Enterprise DM.

```console

<a href="" id="--user-vendor-msft-activesync"></a>**./User/Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync**
The root node for the ActiveSync configuration service provider.

> [!NOTE]
> The target user must be logged in for the CSP to succeed. The correct way to configure an account is to use the `./User/Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync` path.

On the desktop, only per user configuration `./User/Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync` is supported. However, the ./Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync will work if the user is logged in. The CSP fails when no user is logged in.

The `./Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync` path is deprecated, but will continue to work in the short term.

The supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="accounts"></a>**Accounts**
The root node for all ActiveSync accounts.

The supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="account-guid"></a>***Account GUID***
Defines a specific ActiveSync account. A globally unique identifier (GUID) must be generated for each ActiveSync account on the device.

Supported operations are Get, Add, and Delete.

When managing over OMA DM, make sure to always use a unique GUID. Provisioning with an account that has the same GUID as an existing one deletes the existing account and doesn't create the new account.

Braces { } are required around the GUID. In OMA Client Provisioning, you can type the braces. For example:

```xml
<characteristic type="{C556E16F-56C4-4EDB-9C64-D9469EE1FBE0}"/>
```

For OMA DM, you must use the ASCII values of %7B and %7D for the opening and closing braces, respectively. For example, if the GUID is "C556E16F-56C4-4EDB-9C64-D9469EE1FBE0", type:

```xml
<Target>
   <LocURI>
      ./Vendor/MSFT/ActiveSync/Accounts/%7BC556E16F-56C4-4EDB-9C64-D9469EE1FBE0%7D
   </LocURI>
</Target>
```

<a href="" id="account-guid-emailaddress"></a>***Account GUID*/EmailAddress**
Required. A character string that specifies the email address associated with the Exchange ActiveSync account.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Add (can't Add after the account is created).

This email address is entered by the user during setup and must be in the fully qualified email address format, for example, "someone@example.com".

<a href="" id="account-guid-domain"></a>***Account GUID*/Domain**
Optional for Exchange. Specifies the domain name of the Exchange server.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, Add, and Delete.

<a href="" id="account-guid-accounticon"></a>***Account GUID*/AccountIcon**
Required. A character string that specifies the location of the icon associated with the account.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Add (can't Add after the account is created).

The account icon can be used as a tile in the **Start** list or an icon in the applications list under **Settings > email & accounts**. Some icons are already provided on the device. The suggested icon for POP/IMAP or generic ActiveSync accounts is at res://AccountSettingsSharedRes{*ScreenResolution*}!%s.genericmail.png. The suggested icon for Exchange Accounts is at res://AccountSettingsSharedRes{*ScreenResolution*}!%s.office.outlook.png. Custom icons can be added if desired.

<a href="" id="account-guid-accounttype"></a>***Account GUID*/AccountType**
Required. A character string that specifies the account type.

Supported operations are Get and Add (can't Add after the account is created).

This value is entered during setup and can't be modified once entered. An Exchange account is indicated by the string value "Exchange".

<a href="" id="account-guid-accountname"></a>***Account GUID*/AccountName**
Required. A character string that specifies the name that refers to the account on the device.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Add (can't Add after the account is created).

<a href="" id="account-guid-password"></a>***Account GUID*/Password**
Required. A character string that specifies the password for the account.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, Add, and Delete.

For the Get command, only asterisks are returned.

<a href="" id="account-guid-servername"></a>***Account GUID*/ServerName**
Required. A character string that specifies the server name used by the account.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Add (can't Add after the account is created).

<a href="" id="account-guid-username"></a>***Account GUID*/UserName**
Required. A character string that specifies the user name for the account.

Supported operations are Get, and Add (can't Add after the account is created).

The user name can't be changed after a sync has been successfully performed. The user name can be in the fully qualified format "someone@example.com", or just "username", depending on the type of account created. For most Exchange accounts, the user name format is just "username", whereas for Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and most POP/IMAP accounts, the user name format is "someone@example.com".

<a href="" id="options"></a>**Options**
Node for other parameters.

<a href="" id="options-calendaragefilter"></a>**Options/CalendarAgeFilter**

-   2 - Advanced logging is enabled.

Logging is set to off by default. The user might be asked to set this logging to Basic or Advanced when having a sync issue that customer support is investigating. Setting the logging level to Advanced has more of a performance impact than Basic.
