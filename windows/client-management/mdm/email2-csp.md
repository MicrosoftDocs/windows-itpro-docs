# EMAIL2 CSP

The table below shows the applicability of Windows:

|Edition|Windows 10|Windows 11|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Home|Yes|Yes|
|Pro|Yes|Yes|
|Business|Yes|Yes|
|Enterprise|Yes|Yes|
|Education|Yes|Yes|

The EMAIL2 configuration service provider (CSP) is used to configure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email accounts.

> [!Note]
> This configuration service provider requires the ID\_CAP\_CSP\_FOUNDATION and ID\_CAP\_CSP\_MAIL capabilities to be accessed from a network configuration application.

On Windows client, only per user configuration is supported. 

The following information shows the EMAIL2 configuration service provider management object in tree format as used by both OMA DM and OMA Client Provisioning.

After provisioning, the **Start** screen has a tile for the proprietary mail provider and there's also a link to it in the applications list under **Settings, email & accounts**. After an account has been updated over-the-air by the EMAIL2 CSP, the device must be powered off and then powered back on to see the sync status.

Configuration data isn't encrypted when sent over the air (OTA). This is a potential security risk when sending sensitive configuration data, such as passwords.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Add and Replace commands need to be wrapped in an Atomic section.

<a href="" id="email2"></a>**EMAIL2**  
The configuration service provider root node.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="guid"></a>***GUID***  
Defines a specific email account. A globally unique identifier (GUID) must be generated for each email account on the device. Provisioning with an account that has the same GUID as an existing one doesn't create the new account and Add command will fail in this case.

Supported operations are Get, Add, and Delete.

The braces {} around the GUID are required in the EMAIL2 configuration service provider.

- For OMA Client Provisioning, the braces can be sent literally. For example, `<characteristic type="{C556E16F-56C4-4edb-9C64-D9469EE1FBE0}"/>`
- For OMA DM, the braces must be sent using ASCII values of 0x7B and 0x7D respectively. For example, `<Target><LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/EMAIL2/0x7BC556E16F-56C4-4edb-9C64-D9469EE1FBE0x7D</LocURI></Target>`

## Remarks

When an application removal or configuration roll-back is provisioned, the EMAIL2 CSP passes the request to Configuration Manager, which handles the transaction externally. When a MAPI application is removed, the accounts that were created with it are deleted. All messages and other properties that the transport (like Short Message Service \[SMS\], Post Office Protocol \[POP\], or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \[SMTP\]) might have stored, are lost. If an attempt to create a new email account is unsuccessful, the new account is automatically deleted. If an attempt to edit an existing account is unsuccessful, the original configuration is automatically rolled back (restored).

For OMA DM, the EMAIL2 CSP handles the Replace command differently from most other configuration service providers. For the EMAIL2 CSP, Configuration Manager implicitly adds the missing part of the node to be replaced or any segment in the path of the node if it's left out in the \<LocURI>\</LocURI\> block. There are separate parameters defined for the outgoing server logon credentials. The following are the usage rules for these credentials:

- The incoming server logon credentials are used (AUTHNAME, AUTHSECRET, and DOMAIN) unless the outgoing server credentials are set.
- If some of the outgoing server credentials parameters are present, then the EMAIL2 Configuration Service Provider will be considered in error.
- Account details can't be queried unless the account GUID is known. Currently, there's no way to perform a top-level query for account GUIDs.

If the connection to the mail server is initiated with deferred SSL, the mail server can send STARTTLS as a server capability and TLS will be enabled. The following steps show how to enable TLS.

1. The device attempts to connect to the mail server using SSL
2. If the SSL connection fails, the device attempts to connect using deferred SSL
3. If the connection fails over both SSL and deferred SSL, and the user selected **Server requires encrypted (SSL) connection**, the device doesn't attempt another connection
4. If the user didn't select **Server requires encrypted (SSL) connection**, the device attempts to establish a non-SSL connection
5. If the connection succeeds using any of the encryption protocols, the device requests the server capabilities.
6. If one of the capabilities sent by the mail server is STARTTLS and the connection is deferred SSL, then the device enables TLS. TLS isn't enabled on connections using SSL or non-SSL.
