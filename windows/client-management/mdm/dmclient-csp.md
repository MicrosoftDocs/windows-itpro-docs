The DMClient configuration service provider (CSP) has more enterprise-specific mobile device management (MDM) configuration settings. These settings identify the device in the enterprise domain, include security mitigation for certificate renewal, and are used for server-triggered enterprise unenrollment.

The following information shows the DMClient CSP in tree format.

<a href="" id="msft"></a>**./Vendor/MSFT**
All the nodes in this CSP are supported in the device context, except for the **ExchangeID** node, which is supported in the user context. For the device context, use the **./Device/Vendor/MSFT** path and for the user context, use the **./User/Vendor/MSFT** path.

<a href="" id="dmclient"></a>**DMClient**
Root node for the CSP.

<a href="" id="updatemanagementserviceaddress"></a>**UpdateManagementServiceAddress**
For provisioning packages only. Specifies the list of servers (semicolon delimited). The first server in the semicolon-delimited list is the server that will be used to instantiate MDM sessions. The list can be a permutation or a subset of the existing server list. You can't add new servers to the list using this node.

<a href="" id="hwdevid"></a>**HWDevID**
Added in Windows 10, version 1703. Returns the hardware device ID.

Supported operation is Get. Value type is string.

<a href="" id="provider"></a>**Provider**
Required. The root node for all settings that belong to a single management server. Scope is permanent.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid"></a>**Provider/**<strong>*ProviderID*</strong>
Required. This node contains the URI-encoded value of the bootstrapped device management account’s Provider ID. Scope is dynamic. This value is set and controlled by the MDM provider. As a best practice, use text that doesn’t require XML/URI escaping.

Supported operations are Get and Add.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-entdevicename"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/EntDeviceName**
Optional. Character string that contains the user-friendly device name used by the IT admin console. The value is set during the enrollment process using the DMClient CSP. You can retrieve it later during an OMA DM session.

Supported operations are Get and Add.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-entdmid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/EntDMID**
Optional. Character string that contains the unique enterprise device ID. The value is set by the management server during the enrollment process using the DMClient CSP. You can retrieve it later during an OMA DM session.

Supported operations are Get and Add.

> [!NOTE]
> Although hardware device IDs are guaranteed to be unique, there's a concern that this isn't ultimately enforceable during a DM session. The device ID could be changed through the w7 APPLICATION CSP’s **USEHWDEVID** parm by another management server. So during enterprise bootstrap and enrollment, a new device ID is specified by the enterprise server.
This node is required and must be set by the server before the client certificate renewal is triggered.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-exchangeid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/ExchangeID**
Optional. Character string that contains the unique Exchange device ID used by the Outlook account of the user the session is running against. The enterprise management server can correlate and merge records for:

- A device that's managed by Exchange.
- A device that's natively managed by a dedicated management server.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases for the desktop, this node will return "not found" until the user sets up their email.

Supported operation is Get.

The following XML is a Get command example:

```xml
<Get>
   <CmdID>12</CmdID>
   <Item>
      <Target>
         <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/<ProviderID>/ExchangeID</LocURI>
      </Target>
   </Item>
</Get>
```

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-signedentdmid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/SignedEntDMID**
Optional. Character string that contains the device ID. This node and the nodes **CertRenewTimeStamp** can be used by the MDM provider to verify client identity to update the registration record after the device certificate is renewed. The device signs the **EntDMID** with the old client certificate during the certificate renewal process and saves the signature locally.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-certrenewtimestamp"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/CertRenewTimeStamp**
Optional. The time in OMA DM standard time format. This node is designed to reduce the risk of the certificate being used by another device. The device records the time that the new certificate was created.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-managementserviceaddress"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/ManagementServiceAddress**
Required. The character string that contains the device management server address. It can be updated during an OMA DM session by the management server. It allows the server to load balance to another server when too many devices are connected to the server.

> [!NOTE]
> When the **ManagementServerAddressList** value is set, the device ignores the value.

The DMClient CSP will save the address to the same location as the w7 and DMS CSPs. The save ensures the management client has a single place to retrieve the current server address. The initial value for this node is the same server address value as bootstrapped using the [w7 APPLICATION configuration service provider](w7-application-csp.md).

Starting in Windows 10, version 1511, this node supports multiple server addresses in the format &lt;URL1&gt;&lt;URL2&gt;&lt;URL3&gt;. If there's only a single URL, then the &lt;&gt; aren't required. This feature is supported on Windows client devices.

During a DM session, the device will use the first address on the list and then keep going down the list until a successful connection is achieved. The DM client should cache the successfully connected server URL for the next session.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Replace.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-upn"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/UPN**
Optional. Allows the management server to update the User Principal Name (UPN) of the enrolled user. This information is useful when the user's email address changes in the identity system. Or, when the user enters an invalid UPN during enrollment, and fixes the UPN during federated enrollment. The UPN will be recorded and the UX will reflect the updated UPN.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-helpphonenumber"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/HelpPhoneNumber**
Optional. The character string that allows the user experience to include a customized help phone number. Users can see this information if they need help or support.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-helpwebsite"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/HelpWebsite**
Optional. The character string that allows the user experience to include a customized help website. Users can see this information if they need help or support.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Delete

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-helpemailaddress"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/HelpEmailAddress**
Optional. The character string that allows the user experience to include a customized help email address. Users can see this information if they need help or support.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-requiremessagesigning"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/RequireMessageSigning**
Boolean type. Primarily used for SSL bridging mode where firewalls and proxies are deployed and where device client identity is required. When enabled, every SyncML message from the device will carry an additional HTTP header named MDM-Signature. This header contains BASE64-encoded Cryptographic Message Syntax using a Detached Signature of the complete SyncML message SHA-2 (inclusive of the SyncHdr and SyncBody). Signing is performed using the private key of the management session certificate that was enrolled as part of the enrollment process. The device public key and PKCS9 UTC signing time stamp are included in the authenticated attributes in the signature.

Default value is false, where the device management client doesn't include authentication information in the management session HTTP header. Optionally set to true, where the client authentication information is provided in the management session HTTP header.

When enabled, the MDM provider should:

- Validate the signature and the timestamp using the device identify certificate enrolled as part of Mobile Device Enrollment protocol (MS-MDE).
- Ensure the certificate and time are valid.
- Verify that the signature is trusted by the MDM provider.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-syncapplicationversion"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/SyncApplicationVersion**
Optional. Used by the management server to set the DM session version that the server and device should use. Default is 1.0. In Windows 10, the DM session protocol version of the client is 2.0. If the server is updated to support 2.0, then you should set this value to 2.0. In the next session, check to see if there's a client behavior change between 1.0 and 2.0.

> [!NOTE]
> This node is only supported in Windows 10 and later.

Once you set the value to 2.0, it won't go back to 1.0.

Supported operations are Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-maxsyncapplicationversion"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/MaxSyncApplicationVersion**
Optional. Used by the client to indicate the latest DM session version that it supports. Default is 2.0.

When you query this node, a Windows 10 client will return 2.0 and a Windows 8.1 client will return an error code (404 node not found).

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-aadresourceid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/AADResourceID**
Optional. This ResourceID is used when requesting the user token from the OMA DM session for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) enrollments (Azure AD Join or Add Accounts). The token is audience-specific, which allows for different service principals (enrollment vs. device management). It can be an application ID or the endpoint that you're trying to access.

For more information about Azure AD enrollment, see [Azure Active Directory integration with MDM](../azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm.md).

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-enableomadmkeepalivemessage"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/EnableOmaDmKeepAliveMessage**
Added in Windows 10, version 1511. A boolean value that specifies whether the DM client should send out a request pending alert in case the device response to a DM request is too slow.

When the server sends a configuration request, the client can take longer than the HTTP timeout to get all information together. The session might end unexpectedly because of the timeout. By default, the MDM client doesn't send an alert that a DM request is pending.

To work around the timeout, you can use this setting to keep the session alive by sending a heartbeat message back to the server. Send a SyncML message with a specific device alert element in the body until the client can respond back to the server with the requested information.

Here's an example of DM message sent by the device when it's in pending state:

```xml
<SyncML xmlns="SYNCML:SYNCML1.2">
  <SyncHdr>
<VerDTD>1.2</VerDTD>
        <VerProto>DM/1.2</VerProto>
        <SessionID>10</SessionID>
        <MsgID>2</MsgID>
      <Target>
         <LocURI>https://www.contoso.com/mgmt-server</LocURI>
      </Target>
      <Source>
         <LocURI>{unique device ID}</LocURI>
      </Source>
  </SyncHdr>
  <SyncBody>
<Alert>
    <CmdID>2</CmdID>
    <Data>1224</Data>
    <Item>
        <Meta>
            <Type xmlns="syncml:metinf">Reversed-Domain-Name:com.microsoft.mdm.requestpending</Type>
        </Meta>
        <Data>1</Data>
    </Item>
</Alert>
  </SyncBody>
</SyncML>
```

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-aaddeviceid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/AADDeviceID**
Added in Windows 10, version 1607. Returns the device ID for the Azure AD device registration.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-enrollmenttype"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/EnrollmentType**
Added in Windows 10, version 1607. Returns the enrollment type (Device or Full).

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-hwdevid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/HWDevID**
Added in Windows 10, version 1607. Returns the hardware device ID.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-commercialid"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/CommercialID**
Added in Windows 10, version 1607. It configures the identifier that uniquely associates the device's diagnostic data belonging to the organization. If your organization is participating in a program that requires this device to be identified as belonging to your organization, then use this setting to provide that identification. The value for this setting is provided by Microsoft in the onboarding process for the program. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, then Microsoft can't use this identifier to associate this machine and its diagnostic data with your organization.

Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-managementserveraddresslist"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/ManagementServerAddressList**
Added in Windows 10, version 1607. The list of management server URLs in the format &lt;URL1&gt;&lt;URL2&gt;&lt;URL3&gt;, and so on. If there's only one, the angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) aren't required.

> [!NOTE]
> The &lt; and &gt; should be escaped.

```xml
   <Replace>
       <CmdID>101</CmdID>
       <Item>
           <Target>
               <LocURI>
                  ./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/<ProviderID>/ManagementServerAddressList
               </LocURI>
           </Target>
           <Data>&lt;https://server1&gt;&lt;https:// server2&gt; </Data>
       </Item>
   </Replace>
```

If ManagementServerAddressList node is set, the device will only use the server URL configured in this node and ignore the ManagementServiceAddress value.

When the server isn't responding after a specified number of retries, the device tries to use the next server URL in the list. It keeps trying until it gets a successful connection. After the server list is updated, the client uses the updated list at the next session starting with the first one in the list.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

Value type is string.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-managementservertoupgradeto"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/ManagementServerToUpgradeTo**
Optional. Added in Windows 10, version 1703. Specify the Discovery server URL of the MDM provider to upgrade to for a Mobile Application Management (MAM) enrolled device.

Supported operations are Add, Delete, Get, and Replace.

Value type is string.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-numberofdaysafterlostcontacttounenroll"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/NumberOfDaysAfterLostContactToUnenroll**
Optional. Number of days after last successful sync to unenroll.

Supported operations are Add, Delete, Get, and Replace.

Value type is integer.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-aadsenddevicetoken"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/AADSendDeviceToken**

Device. Added in Windows 10 version 1803. For Azure AD backed enrollments, this feature will cause the client to send a Device Token if the User Token can't be obtained.

Supported operations are Add, Delete, Get, and Replace.

Value type is bool.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-forceaadtoken"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/ForceAadToken**
The value type is integer/enum.

The value is "1" and it means client should always send Azure Active Directory device token during check-in/sync.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll**
Optional. Polling schedules must use the DMClient CSP. The Registry paths previously associated with polling using the Registry CSP are now deprecated.

Supported operations are Get and Add.

There are three schedules managed under the Poll node. They enable a rich polling schedule experience to provide greater flexibility in managing the way devices poll the management server. There are various ways that polling schedules may be set. If an invalid polling configuration is set, the device will correct or remove the schedules to restore the polling schedules back to a valid configuration.

If there's no infinite schedule set, then a 24-hour schedule is created and scheduled to launch in the maintenance window.

**Valid poll schedule: sigmoid polling schedule with infinite schedule (Recommended).**

|Schedule name|Schedule set by the server|Actual value queried on device|
|--- |--- |--- |
|IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries|15|15|
|NumberOfFirstRetries|5|5|
|IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries|60|60|
|NumberOfSecondRetries|10|10|
|IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries|1440|1440|
|NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries|0|0|

**Valid poll schedule: initial enrollment only [no infinite schedule]**

|Schedule name|Schedule set by the server|Actual value queried on device|
|--- |--- |--- |
|IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries|15|15|
|NumberOfFirstRetries|5|5|
|IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries|60|60|
|NumberOfSecondRetries|10|10|
|IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries|0|0|
|NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries|0|0|

**Invalid poll schedule: disable all poll schedules**

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling poll schedules results in UNDEFINED behavior and enrollment may fail if poll schedules are all set to zero.

|Schedule name|Schedule set by the server|Actual value queried on device|
|--- |--- |--- |
|IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries|0|0|
|NumberOfFirstRetries|0|0|
|IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries|0|0|
|NumberOfSecondRetries|0|0|
|IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries|0|0|
|NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries|0|0|

**Invalid poll schedule: two infinite schedules**

|Schedule name|Schedule set by server|Actual schedule set on device|Actual experience|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries|15|15|Device polls|
|NumberOfFirstRetries|5|5|Device polls|
|IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries|1440|1440|Device polls the server once in 24 hours|
|NumberOfSecondRetries|0|0|Device polls the server once in 24 hours|
|IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries|1440|0|Third schedule is disabled|
|NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries|0|0|Third schedule is disabled|

If the device was previously enrolled in MDM with polling schedule configured using the registry key values directly, the MDM provider that supports using DMClient CSP to update polling schedule must first send an Add command to add a **./Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Enrollment/&lt;ProviderID&gt;/Poll** node before it sends a Get/Replace command to query or update polling parameters using the DMClient CSP

When using the DMClient CSP to configure polling schedule parameters, the server must not set all six polling parameters to 0, or set all three number of retry nodes to 0. It will cause a configuration failure.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-intervalforfirstsetofretries"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries**
Optional. The waiting time (in minutes) for the initial set of retries, which is the number of retries in `/<ProviderID>/Poll/NumberOfFirstRetries`. If IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries isn't set, then the default value is used. The default value is 15. If the value is set to 0, this schedule is disabled.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

The IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries replaces the deprecated HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Enrollment\\OmaDmRetry\\AuxRetryInterval path that previously used the Registry CSP.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-numberoffirstretries"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/NumberOfFirstRetries**
Optional. The number of times the DM client should retry to connect to the server when the client is initially configured or enrolled to communicate with the server. If the value is set to 0 and the IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries value isn't 0, then the schedule will be set to repeat an infinite number of times and second set and this set of schedule won't set in this case. The default value is 10.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

The NumberOfFirstRetries replaces the deprecated HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Enrollment\\OmaDmRetry\\AuxNumRetries path that previously used the Registry CSP.

The first set of retries gives the management server some buffered time to be ready to send policy and setting configurations to the device. The total time for first set of retries shouldn't be more than a few hours. The server shouldn't set NumberOfFirstRetries to 0. RemainingScheduledRetries is used for the long run device polling schedule.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-intervalforsecondsetofretries"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries**
Optional. The waiting time (in minutes) for the second set of retries, which is the number of retries in `/<ProviderID>/Poll/NumberOfSecondRetries`. Default value is 0. If this value is set to zero, then this schedule is disabled.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

The IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries replaces the deprecated HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Enrollment\\OmaDmRetry\\RetryInterval path that previously used the Registry CSP.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-numberofsecondretries"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/NumberOfSecondRetries**
Optional. The number of times the DM client should retry a second round of connecting to the server when the client is initially configured/enrolled to communicate with the server. Default value is 0. If the value is set to 0 and IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries isn't set to 0 AND the first set of retries isn't set as infinite retries, then the schedule repeats an infinite number of times. However, if the first set of retries is set at infinite, then this schedule is disabled.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

The NumberOfSecondRetries replaces the deprecated HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Enrollment\\OmaDmRetry\\NumRetries path that previously used the Registry CSP.

The second set of retries is also optional and temporarily retries that the total duration should be last for more than a day. And the IntervalForSecondSetOfRetries should be longer than IntervalForFirstSetOfRetries. RemainingScheduledRetries is used for the long run device polling schedule.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-intervalforremainingscheduledretries"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries**
Optional. The waiting time (in minutes) for the initial set of retries, which is the number of retries in `/<ProviderID>/Poll/NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries`. Default value is 0. If IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries is set to 0, then this schedule is disabled.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

The IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries replaces the deprecated HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Enrollment\\OmaDmRetry\\Aux2RetryInterval path that previously used the Registry CSP.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-numberofremainingscheduledretries"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries**
Optional. The number of times the DM client should retry connecting to the server when the client is initially configured/enrolled to communicate with the server. Default value is 0. If the value is set to 0 and IntervalForRemainingScheduledRetries AND the first and second set of retries aren't set as infinite retries, then the schedule will be set to repeat for an infinite number of times. However, if either or both of the first and second set of retries are set as infinite, then this schedule will be disabled.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

The NumberOfRemainingScheduledRetries replaces the deprecated HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Enrollment\\OmaDmRetry\\Aux2NumRetries path that previously used the Registry CSP.

The RemainingScheduledRetries is used for the long run device polling schedule.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-pollonlogin"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/PollOnLogin**
Optional. Boolean value that allows the IT admin to require the device to start a management session on any user login, even if the user has previously logged in. Login isn't the same as device unlock. Default value is false, where polling is disabled on first login. Supported values are true or false.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Replace.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-poll-alluserspollonfirstlogin"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Poll/AllUsersPollOnFirstLogin**
Optional. Boolean value that allows the IT admin to require the device to start a management session on first user login for all NT users. A session is only kicked off the first time a user logs in to the system. Later sign-ins won't trigger an MDM session. Login isn't the same as device unlock. Default value is false, where polling is disabled on first login. Supported values are true or false.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Replace.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-linkedenrollment-priority"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/LinkedEnrollment/Priority**
This node is an integer, value is "0" or "1".

Default is 1, meaning the MDM enrollment is the “winning” authority for conflicting policies/resources. Value 1 means MMP-C enrollment is the “winning” one.
Support operations are Get and Set.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-linkedenrollment-enroll"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/LinkedEnrollment/Enroll**
This is an execution node and will trigger a silent MMP-C enrollment, using the Azure Active Directory device token pulled from the Azure AD-joined device. There is no user interaction needed.

Support operation is Exec.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-linkedenrollment-unenroll"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/LinkedEnrollment/Unenroll**
This is an execution node and will trigger a silent MMP-C unenroll, there is no user interaction needed. On un-enrollment, all the settings/resources set by MMPC will be rolled back(rollback details will be covered later).

Support operation is Exec.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-linkedenrollment-enrollstatus"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/LinkedEnrollment/EnrollStatus**

This node can be used to check both enroll and unenroll statuses.
This will return the enroll action status and is defined as an enum class LinkedEnrollmentStatus. The values are as follows:

- Undefined = 0
- EnrollmentNotStarted = 1
- InProgress = 2
- Failed = 3
- Succeeded = 4
- UnEnrollmentQueued = 5
- UnEnrollmentSucceeded = 8

Support operation is Get only.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-recovery-allowrecovery"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Recovery/AllowRecovery**

This node determines whether or not the client will automatically initiate an MDM Recovery operation when it detects issues with the MDM certificate.

Supported operations are Get, Add, Replace and Delete.

The supported values for this node are 1-true (allow) and 0-false(not allow). Default value is 0.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-recovery-recoverystatus"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Recovery/RecoveryStatus**

This node tracks the status of a Recovery request from the InitiateRecovery node. The values are as follows:

0 - No Recovery request has been processed.
1 - Recovery is in Process.
2 - Recovery has finished successfully.
3 - Recovery has failed to start because TPM is not available.
4 - Recovery has failed to start because Azure Active Directory keys are not protected by the TPM.
5 - Recovery has failed to start because the MDM keys are already protected by the TPM.
6 - Recovery has failed to start because the TPM is not ready for attestation.
7 - Recovery has failed because the client cannot authenticate to the server.
8 - Recovery has failed because the server has rejected the client's request.

Supported operation is Get only.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-recovery-initiaterecovery"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/Recovery/InitiateRecovery**

This node initiates an MDM Recovery operation on the client.

If initiated with argument 0, it triggers MDM Recovery, no matter the state of the device.

If initiated with argument 1, it triggers only if the MDM certificate’s private key isn’t already protected by the TPM, if there is a TPM to put the private key into, and if the TPM is ready for attestation.

Supported operation is Exec only.

<a href="" id="provider-providerid-multiplesession-numallowedconcurrentusersessionforbackgroundsync"></a>**Provider/*ProviderID*/MultipleSession/NumAllowedConcurrentUserSessionForBackgroundSync**

Optional. This node specifies maximum number of concurrent user sync sessions in background.

The default value is dynamically decided by the client based on CPU usage.

The values are as follows:
