<a href="" id="allowvirtualgpu"></a>**Settings/AllowVirtualGPU**
Added in Windows 10, version 1803. This policy setting allows you to determine whether Application Guard can use the virtual Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to process graphics.

Value type is integer.

Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

This policy setting is supported on Microsoft Edge on Windows 10/Windows 11 Enterprise or Windows 10/Windows 11 Education with Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Enterprise mode.

If you enable this setting, Microsoft Defender Application Guard uses Hyper-V to access supported, high-security rendering graphics hardware (GPUs). These GPUs improve rendering performance and battery life while using Microsoft Defender Application Guard, particularly for video playback and other graphics-intensive use cases. If you enable this setting without connecting any high-security rendering graphics hardware, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will automatically revert to software-based (CPU) rendering.

The following list shows the supported values:

- 0 (default) - Can't access the vGPU and uses the CPU to support rendering graphics. When the policy isn't configured, it's the same as disabled (0).
- 1 - Turns on the functionality to access the vGPU offloading graphics rendering from the CPU. This functionality can create a faster experience when working with graphics intense websites or watching video within the container.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling this setting with potentially compromised graphics devices or drivers might pose a risk to the host device.
