The DevDetail configuration service provider handles the management object that provides device-specific parameters to the OMA DM server. These device parameters can be queried by servers using OMA DM commands. They aren't sent from the client to the server automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration service provider requires the ID\_CAP\_CSP\_FOUNDATION and ID\_CAP\_DEVICE\_MANAGEMENT\_ADMIN capabilities to be accessed from a network configuration application.

For the DevDetail CSP, you can't use the Replace command unless the node already exists.

The following information shows the DevDetail configuration service provider management object in tree format as used by OMA Device Management. The OMA Client Provisioning protocol isn't supported for this configuration service provider.

<!-- 12.15.2021 (mandia): Based on the description, I'm assuming this ID is specific to Windows 10 Mobile. Commented out as Windows 10 Mobile is past EoL.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-mobileid"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/MobileID**
Required. Returns the mobile device ID associated with the cellular network. Returns 404 for devices that don't have a cellular network support.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-radioswv"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/RadioSwV**
Required. Returns the radio stack software version number.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-resolution"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/Resolution**
Required. Returns the UI screen resolution of the device (example: &quot;480x800&quot;).

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-commercializationoperator"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/CommercializationOperator**

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-processorarchitecture"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/ProcessorArchitecture**
Required. Returns the processor architecture of the device as &quot;arm&quot; or &quot;x86&quot;.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-processortype"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/ProcessorType**

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-osplatform"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/OSPlatform**
Required. Returns the OS platform of the device. For Windows 10 for desktop editions, it returns the ProductName as defined in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-devicename"></a>**Ext/Microsoft/DeviceName**
Required. Contains the user-specified device name.

Replace operation isn't supported in Windows client or IoT Core. When you change the device name using this node, it triggers a dialog on the device asking the user to reboot. The new device name doesn't take effect until the device is restarted. If the user cancels the dialog, it will show again until a reboot occurs.

Value type is string.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

<a href="" id="ext-microsoft-dnscomputername "></a>**Ext/Microsoft/DNSComputerName**
Added in Windows 10, version 2004. This node specifies the DNS computer name for a device. The server must explicitly reboot the device for this value to take effect. A couple of macros can be embedded within the value for dynamic substitution. Using any of these macros will limit the new name to 63 characters. This node replaces the **Domain/ComputerName** node in [Accounts CSP](accounts-csp.md).

The following are the available naming macros:

| Macro | Description | Example | Generated Name |
| -------| -------| -------| -------|
| %RAND:<# of digits> | Generates the specified number of random digits. | `Test%RAND:6%` | Test123456|
| %SERIAL% | Generates the serial number derived from the device. If the serial number causes the new name to exceed the 63 character limit, the serial number will be truncated from the beginning of the sequence.| `Test-Device-%SERIAL%` | Test-Device-456|

Value type is string. Supported operations are Get and Replace.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using `%SERIAL%` or `%RAND:x%` with a high character limit to reduce the chance of name collision when generating a random name. This feature doesn't check if a particular name is already present in the environment.

On desktop PCs, this setting specifies the DNS hostname of the computer (Computer Name) up to 63 characters. Use `%RAND:x%` to generate x number of random digits in the name, where x must be a number less than 63. For domain-joined computers, the unique name must use `%RAND:x%`. Use `%SERIAL%` to generate the name with the computer's serial number embedded. If the serial number exceeds the character limit, it will be truncated from the beginning of the sequence. The character restriction limit doesn't count the length of the macros, `%RAND:x%` and `%SERIAL%`. This setting is supported only in Windows 10, version 1803 and later. To change this setting in Windows 10, version 1709 and earlier releases, use the **ComputerName** setting under **Accounts** > **ComputerAccount**.
