<!--Description-->
This policy setting blocks application from using the network to send tile, badge, toast, and raw notifications. Specifically, this policy setting turns off the connection between Windows and the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS). This policy setting also stops applications from being able to use [periodic (polling) notifications](/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/periodic-notification-overview).

If you enable this policy setting, applications and system features won't be able to receive notifications from the network from WNS or via notification polling APIs.

If you enable this policy setting, notifications can still be raised by applications running on the machine via local API calls from within the application.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the client computer will connect to WNS at user sign in, and applications will be allowed to use periodic (polling) notifications.

No reboots or service restarts are required for this policy setting to take effect.

> [!WARNING]
> This policy is designed for zero exhaust. This policy may cause some MDM processes to break because WNS notification is used by the MDM server to send real time tasks to the device, such as remote wipe, unenroll, remote find, and mandatory app installation. When this policy is set to disallow WNS, those real time processes will no longer work and some time-sensitive actions such as remote wipe when the device is stolen or unenrollment when the device is compromised will not work.

<!--Description-->
Boolean value that turns off notification mirroring.

For each user signed in to the device, if you enable this policy (set value to 1), the app and system notifications received by this user on this device won't get mirrored to other devices of the same signed-in user. If you disable or don't configure this policy (set value to 0), the notifications received by this user on this device will be mirrored to other devices of the same signed-in user. This feature can be turned off by apps that don't want to participate in Notification Mirroring. This feature can also be turned off by the user in the Cortana setting page.

No reboot or service restart is required for this policy to take effect.
