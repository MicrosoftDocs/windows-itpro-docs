# VPN CSP

The VPN CSP is deprecated. Use [VPNv2 CSP](vpnv2-csp.md) instead.

<!-- 12.16.2021 mandia: Commenting out, as this CSP is specific to Windows 10 Mobile.

The VPN configuration service provider allows the MDM server to configure the VPN profile of the device. Windows 10 supports both IKEv2 VPN and SSL VPN profiles. For information about IKEv2, see [Configure IKEv2-based Remote Access](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ff687731(v=ws.10)).

> **Note**   The VPN CSP is deprecated in Windows 10 and it only supported in Windows 10 Mobile for backward compatibility. Use [VPNv2 CSP](vpnv2-csp.md) instead.

 

Important considerations:

-   For a VPN that requires a client certificate, the server must first enroll the needed client certificate before deploying a VPN profile to ensure that there is a functional VPN profile at the device. This is critical for forced tunnel VPN.

-   VPN configuration commands must be wrapped with an Atomic command as shown in the example below.

-   Only one VPN profile provisioning per one OMA request is supported. Multiple VPN profiles per one OMA message request are not supported.

-   For the VPN CSP, you cannot use the Replace command unless the node already exists.

The following shows the VPN configuration service provider in tree format.
