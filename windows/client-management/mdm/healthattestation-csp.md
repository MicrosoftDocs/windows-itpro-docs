# Device HealthAttestation CSP

The Device HealthAttestation configuration service provider (DHA-CSP) enables enterprise IT managers to assess if a device is booted to a trusted and compliant state, and take enterprise policy actions.

The following is a list of functions performed by the Device HealthAttestation CSP:

-   Collects device boot logs, TPM audit trails and the TPM certificate (DHA-BootData) from a managed device
-   Forwards DHA-BootData to Device Health Attestation Service (DHA-Service)
-   Receives an encrypted blob (DHA-EncBlob) from DHA-Service, and stores it in a local cache on the device
-   Receives attestation requests (DHA-Requests) from a DHA-Enabled MDM, and replies with Device Health Attestation data (DHA-Data

## Terms

## **DHA-CSP integration steps**


The following list of validation and development tasks are required for integrating the Microsoft Device Health Attestation feature with a Windows Mobile device management solution (MDM):


1.  [Verify HTTPS access](#verify-access)
2.  [Assign an enterprise trusted DHA-Service](#assign-trusted-dha-service)
3.  [Instruct client to prepare DHA-data for verification](#prepare-health-data)
4.  [Take action based on the clients response](#take-action-client-response)
5.  [Instruct the client to forward DHA-data for verification](#forward-health-attestation)
6.  [Post DHA-data to DHA-service](#forward-data-to-has)
7.  [Receive response from DHA-service](#receive-has-response)
8.  [Parse DHA-Report data. Take appropriate policy action based on evaluation results](#take-policy-action)

Each step is described in detail in the following sections of this topic.

## <a href="" id="verify-access"></a>**Step 1: Verify HTTPS access**


Validate that both the MDM server and the device (MDM client) can access has.spserv.microsoft.com using the TCP protocol over port 443 (HTTPS).

You can use OpenSSL to validate access to DHA-Service. Here is a sample OpenSSL command and the response that was generated by DHA-Service:

``` syntax
PS C:\openssl> ./openssl.exe s_client -connect has.spserv.microsoft.com:443
CONNECTED(000001A8)

## <a href="" id="assign-trusted-dha-service"></a>**Step 2: Assign an enterprise trusted DHA-Service**

There are three types of DHA-Service:
- Device Health Attestation – Cloud (owned and operated by Microsoft)
- Device Health Attestation – On Premise (owned and operated by an enterprise, runs on Windows Server 2016 on premises)
- Device Health Attestation - Enterprise Managed Cloud (owned and operated by an enterprise, runs on Windows Server 2016 compatible enterprise managed cloud)

DHA-Cloud is the default setting. No further action is required if an enterprise is planning to use Microsoft DHA-Cloud as the trusted DHA-Service provider.

For DHA-OnPrem & DHA-EMC scenarios, send a SyncML command to the HASEndpoint node to instruct a managed device to communicate with the enterprise trusted DHA-Service. 

The following example shows a sample call that instructs a managed device to communicate with an enterprise managed DHA-Service.

``` syntax
      <Replace>
         <CmdID>1</CmdID>
         <Item>
            <Target>
               <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/HASEndpoint</LocURI>
            </Target>
            <Data> www.ContosoDHA-Service</Data>
         </Item>
      </Replace>
```


## <a href="" id="prepare-health-data"></a>**Step 3: Instruct client to prepare health data for verification**


Send a SyncML call to start collection of the DHA-Data.

The following example shows a sample call that triggers collection and verification of health attestation data from a managed device.

``` syntax
      <Exec>
         <CmdID>1</CmdID>
         <Item>
            <Target>
               <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/VerifyHealth</LocURI>
            </Target>
         </Item>
      </Exec>

      <Get>
         <CmdID>2</CmdID>
         <Item>
            <Target>
               <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/Status</LocURI>
            </Target>
         </Item>
      </Get>
```

## <a href="" id="take-action-client-response"></a>**Step 4: Take action based on the clients response**


After the client receives the health attestation request, it sends a response. The following list describes the responses, along with a recommended action to take.

- If the response is HEALTHATTESTATION\_CERT_RETRI_COMPLETE (3) then proceed to the next section.
- If the response is HEALTHATTESTATION_CERT_RETRI_REQUESTED (1) or HEALTHATTESTATION_CERT_RETRI_UNINITIALIZED (0) wait for an alert, then proceed to the next section.

Here is a sample alert that is issued by DHA_CSP:

``` syntax
        <Alert>
            <CmdID>1</CmdID>
            <Data>1226</Data>
            <Item>
                <Source>
                    <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/VerifyHealth</LocURI>
                </Source>
                <Meta>
                    <Type xmlns="syncml:metinf">com.microsoft.mdm:HealthAttestation.Result</Type>
                    <Format xmlns="syncml:metinf">int</Format>
                </Meta>
                <Data>3</Data>
            </Item>
        </Alert>
```
- If the response to the status node is not 0, 1 or 3, then troubleshoot the issue. For the complete list of status codes see [Device HealthAttestation CSP status and error codes](#device-healthattestation-csp-status-and-error-codes).

## <a href="" id="forward-health-attestation"></a>**Step 5: Instruct the client to forward health attestation data for verification**


Create a call to the **Nonce**, **Certificate** and **CorrelationId** nodes, and pick up an encrypted payload that includes a health certificate and related data from the device.

Here is an example:

``` syntax
<Replace>
           <CmdID>1</CmdID>
           <Item>
               <Target>
                   <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/Nonce</LocURI>
               </Target>
               <Data>AAAAAAAAAFFFFFFF</Data>
           </Item>
</Replace>
     
	<Get>
            <CmdID>2</CmdID>
            <Item>
                <Target>
                    <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/Certificate</LocURI>
                </Target>
            </Item>
        </Get>

	 <Get>
            <CmdID>3</CmdID>
            <Item>
                <Target>
                    <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/CorrelationId </LocURI>
                </Target>
            </Item>
     </Get>

```

## <a href="" id="forward-data-to-has"></a>**Step 6: Forward device health attestation data to DHA-service**


In response to the request that was sent in the previous step, the MDM client forwards an XML formatted blob (response from ./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/Certificate node) and a call identifier called CorrelationId (response  to ./Vendor/MSFT/HealthAttestation/CorrelationId node).

When the MDM-Server receives the above data, it must: 
- Log the CorrelationId it receives from the device (for future troubleshooting/reference), correlated to the call.
- Decode the XML formatted data blob it receives from the device
- Append the nonce that was generated by MDM service (add the nonce that was forwarded to the device in Step 5) to the XML structure that was forwarded by the device in following format:

``` syntax
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
<HealthCertificateValidationRequest ProtocolVersion='1' xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/security/healthcertificate/validation/request/v1'>
    <Nonce>[INT]</Nonce>
    <Claims> [base64 blob, eg ‘ABc123+/…==’] </Claims>
    <HealthCertificateBlob> [base64 blob, eg ‘ABc123+/...==’]
    </HealthCertificateBlob>
</HealthCertificateValidationRequest>
```
- Forward (HTTP Post) the XML data struct (including the nonce that was appended in the previous step) to the assigned DHA-Service that runs on:
    - DHA-Cloud (Microsoft owned and operated DHA-Service) scenario: https://has.spserv.microsoft.com/DeviceHealthAttestation/ValidateHealthCertificate/v3
    - DHA-OnPrem or DHA-EMC: https://FullyQualifiedDomainName-FDQN/DeviceHealthAttestation/ValidateHealthCertificate/v3


## <a href="" id="receive-has-response"></a>**Step 7: Receive response from the DHA-service**

When the Microsoft Device Health Attestation Service receives a request for verification, it performs the following steps:
- Decrypts the encrypted data it receives.
- Validates the data it has received 
- Creates a report, and shares the evaluation results to the MDM server via SSL in XML format 

## <a href="" id="take-policy-action"></a>**Step 8: Take appropriate policy action based on evaluation results**


After the MDM server receives the verified data, the information can be used to make policy decisions by evaluating the data. Some possible actions would be:

-   Allow the device access.
-   Allow the device to access the resources, but flag the device for further investigation.
-   Prevent a device from accessing resources.
