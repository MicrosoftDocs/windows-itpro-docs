Per Process System DPI is an application compatibility feature for desktop applications that do not render properly after a display-scale factor (DPI) change. When the display scale factor of the primary display changes (which can happen when you connect or disconnect a display that has a different display scale factor (DPI), connect remotely from a device with a different display scale factor, or manually change the display scale factor), many desktop applications can display blurry. Desktop applications that have not been updated to display properly in this scenario will be blurry until the user logs out and back in to Windows.

When you enable this policy some blurry applications will be crisp after they are restarted, without requiring the user to log out and back in to Windows.

Be aware of the following:

Per Process System DPI will only improve the rendering of desktop applications that are positioned on the primary display. Some desktop applications can still be blurry on secondary displays that have different display scale factors.

Per Process System DPI will not work for all applications as some older desktop applications will always be blurry on high DPI displays.

In some cases, you may see some odd behavior in some desktop applications. If that happens, Per Process System DPI should be disabled.

Enabling this setting lets you specify the system-wide default for desktop applications as well as per-application overrides. If you disable or do not configure this setting, Per Process System DPI will not apply to any processes on the system.

Per Process System DPI is an application compatibility feature for desktop applications that don't render properly after a display-scale factor (DPI) change. When the display scale factor of the primary display changes (which can happen when you connect or disconnect a display that has a different display scale factor (DPI), connect remotely from a device with a different display scale factor, or manually change the display scale factor), many desktop applications can display blurry. Desktop applications that haven't been updated to display properly in this scenario will be blurry until you sign out and back in to Windows.

When you enable this policy some blurry applications will be crisp after they're restarted, without requiring the user to sign out and back in to Windows.

Be aware of the following points:

Per Process System DPI will only improve the rendering of desktop applications that are positioned on the primary display (or any other display having the same scale factor as that of the primary display). Some desktop applications can still be blurry on secondary displays that have different display scale factors.

Per Process System DPI won't work for all applications as some older desktop applications will always be blurry on high DPI displays.

In some cases, you may see some unexpected behavior in some desktop applications that have Per-Process System DPI applied. If that happens, Per Process System DPI should be disabled.

Enabling this setting lets you specify the system-wide default for desktop applications and per-application overrides. If you disable or don't configure this setting, Per Process System DPI won't apply to any processes on the system.

GDI DPI Scaling enables applications that are not DPI aware to become per monitor DPI aware.

This policy setting lets you specify legacy applications that have GDI DPI Scaling turned off.

- If you enable this policy setting, GDI DPI Scaling is turned off for all applications in the list, even if they are enabled by using ApplicationCompatibility database, ApplicationCompatibility UI System (Enhanced) setting, or an application manifest.

- If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, GDI DPI Scaling might still be turned on for legacy applications.

If GDI DPI Scaling is configured to both turn off and turn on an application, the application will be turned off.

To validate on Desktop, do the following tasks:

1.   Configure the setting for an app, which has GDI DPI scaling enabled via MDM or any other supported mechanisms.
2.   Run the app and observe blurry text.
