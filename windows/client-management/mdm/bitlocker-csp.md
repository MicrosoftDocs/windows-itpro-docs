# BitLocker CSP

The BitLocker configuration service provider (CSP) is used by the enterprise to manage encryption of PCs and devices. This CSP was added in Windows 10, version 1703. Starting in Windows 10, version 1809, it's also supported in Windows 10 Pro.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings are enforced only at the time encryption is started. Encryption isn't restarted with settings changes.
>
> You must send all the settings together in a single SyncML to be effective.

A `Get` operation on any of the settings, except for `RequireDeviceEncryption` and `RequireStorageCardEncryption`, returns the setting configured by the admin.

For RequireDeviceEncryption and RequireStorageCardEncryption, the Get operation returns the actual status of enforcement to the admin, such as if Trusted Platform Module (TPM) protection is required and if encryption is required. And if the device has BitLocker enabled but with password protector, the status reported is 0. A Get operation on RequireDeviceEncryption doesn't verify that a minimum PIN length is enforced (SystemDrivesMinimumPINLength).

The following example shows the BitLocker configuration service provider in tree format.

```console
./Device/Vendor/MSFT

Data type is integer. Sample value for this node to enable this policy: 1.
Supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

The status of OS volumes and encryptable fixed data volumes is checked with a Get operation. Typically, BitLocker/Device Encryption will follow whichever value [EncryptionMethodByDriveType](#encryptionmethodbydrivetype) policy is set to. However, this policy setting will be ignored for self-encrypting fixed drives and self-encrypting OS drives.

Encryptable fixed data volumes are treated similarly to OS volumes. However, fixed data volumes must meet other criteria to be considered encryptable:

- It must not be a dynamic volume.
- It must not be a recovery partition.
- It must not be a hidden volume.
- It must not be a system partition.
- It must not be backed by virtual storage.
- It must not have a reference in the BCD store.
<!--SupportedValues-->
The following list shows the supported values:

- 0 (default): Disable. If the policy setting isn't set or is set to 0, the device's enforcement status isn't checked. The policy doesn't enforce encryption and it doesn't decrypt encrypted volumes.
- 1: Enable. The device's enforcement status is checked. Setting this policy to 1 triggers encryption of all drives (silently or non-silently based on [AllowWarningForOtherDiskEncryption](#allowwarningforotherdiskencryption) policy).
<!--/SupportedValues-->
If you want to disable this policy, use the following SyncML:

```xml

<a href="" id="encryptionmethodbydrivetype"></a>**EncryptionMethodByDriveType**
<!--Description-->
Allows you to set the default encryption method for each of the different drive types: operating system drives, fixed data drives, and removable data drives. Hidden, system, and recovery partitions are skipped from encryption. This setting is a direct mapping to the BitLocker Group Policy "Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength (Windows 10 [Version 1511] and later)".

- GP name: *EncryptionMethodWithXts_Name*
- GP path: *Windows Components/BitLocker Drive Encryption*
- GP ADMX file name: *VolumeEncryption.admx*

<!--/ADMXMapped-->

This setting allows you to configure the algorithm and cipher strength used by BitLocker Drive Encryption. This setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Changing the encryption method has no effect if the drive is already encrypted, or if encryption is in progress.

If you enable this setting, you'll be able to configure an encryption algorithm and key cipher strength for fixed data drives, operating system drives, and removable data drives individually. For fixed and operating system drives, we recommend that you use the XTS-AES algorithm. For removable drives, you should use AES-CBC 128-bit or AES-CBC 256-bit if the drive will be used in other devices that aren't running Windows 10, version 1511.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use the default encryption method of XTS-AES 128-bit or the encryption method specified by any setup script.

 Sample value for this node to enable this policy and set the encryption methods is:

```xml
 <enabled/><data id="EncryptionMethodWithXtsOsDropDown_Name" value="xx"/><data id="EncryptionMethodWithXtsFdvDropDown_Name" value="xx"/><data id="EncryptionMethodWithXtsRdvDropDown_Name" value="xx"/>
```

- EncryptionMethodWithXtsOsDropDown_Name = Select the encryption method for operating system drives.
- EncryptionMethodWithXtsFdvDropDown_Name = Select the encryption method for fixed data drives.
- EncryptionMethodWithXtsRdvDropDown_Name = Select the encryption method for removable data drives.
<!--SupportedValues-->
 The possible values for 'xx' are:

- 3 = AES-CBC 128
- 4 = AES-CBC 256
- 6 = XTS-AES 128
- 7 = XTS-AES 256
<!--/SupportedValues-->
> [!NOTE]
> When you enable EncryptionMethodByDriveType, you must specify values for all three drives (operating system, fixed data, and removable data), otherwise it will fail (500 return status). For example, if you only set the encrytion method for the OS and removable drives, you will get a 500 return status.

  If you want to disable this policy, use the following SyncML:

```xml
<Replace>

- GP name: *IdentificationField_Name*
- GP path: *Windows Components/BitLocker Drive Encryption*
- GP ADMX file name: *VolumeEncryption.admx*

<!--/ADMXMapped-->

This setting is used to establish an identifier that is applied to all encrypted drives in your organization.

Identifiers are stored as the identification field and the allowed identification field. You can configure the following identification fields on existing drives by using the [Manage-bde](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/manage-bde):

- **BitLocker identification field**: It allows you to associate unique organizational identifiers to a new drive that is enabled with BitLocker. This identifier is automatically added to new BitLocker-protected drives, and it can be updated on existing BitLocker-protected drives by using the Manage-bde command-line tool. For more information about the tool to manage BitLocker, see [Manage-bde](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/manage-bde). An identification field is required to manage certificate-based data recovery agents on BitLocker-protected drives and for potential updates to the BitLocker To Go Reader. BitLocker manages and updates data recovery agents only when the identification field on the drive matches the value that is configured in the identification field. In a similar manner, BitLocker updates the BitLocker To Go Reader only when the identification field on the drive matches the value that is configured for the identification field.

- **Allowed BitLocker identification field**: The allowed identification field is used in combination with the 'Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker' policy setting to help control the use of removable drives in your organization. It's a comma-separated list of identification fields from your organization or external organizations.

>[!Note]
>When a BitLocker-protected drive is mounted on another BitLocker-enabled computer, the identification field and the allowed identification field are used to determine whether the drive is from an outside organization.

If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the identification field on the BitLocker-protected drive and any allowed identification field that is used by your organization.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

```xml
<enabled/><data id="IdentificationField" value="BitLocker-ID1"/><data id="SecIdentificationField" value="Allowed-BitLocker-ID2"/>
```

Data ID:

- IdentificationField: This is a BitLocker identification field.
- SecIdentificationField: This is an allowed BitLocker identification field.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, the identification field isn't required.

>[!Note]
>Multiple values separated by commas can be entered in the identification and allowed identification fields. The identification field can be any value up to 260 characters.

<!--/ADMXMapped-->

This setting permits the use of enhanced PINs when you use an unlock method that includes a PIN. Enhanced startup PINs permit the usage of characters (including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

>[!Note]
>Not all computers support enhanced PIN characters in the preboot environment. It's strongly recommended that users perform a system check during the BitLocker setup to verify that enhanced PIN characters can be used.

If you enable this policy setting, all new BitLocker startup PINs that are set will be enhanced PINs. Existing drives that were protected by using standard startup PINs aren't affected.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

The Windows touch keyboard (such as used by tablets) isn't available in the preboot environment where BitLocker requires additional information, such as a PIN or password.

It's recommended that administrators enable this policy only for devices that are verified to have an alternative means of preboot input, such as attaching a USB keyboard.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

```xml
<enabled/>
```

If this policy is disabled, the Windows Recovery Environment must be enabled on tablets to support entering the BitLocker recovery password.

When the Windows Recovery Environment isn't enabled and this policy isn't enabled, you can't turn on BitLocker on a device that uses the Windows touch keyboard.

>[!Note]

<!--/ADMXMapped-->

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Changing the encryption type will have no effect if the drive is already encrypted or if encryption is in progress.

Choose Full encryption to require that the entire drive be encrypted when BitLocker is turned on. Choose Used Space Only encryption to require that only the portion of the drive that is used to store data is encrypted when BitLocker is turned on.

If you enable this policy setting, the encryption type that BitLocker uses to encrypt drives is defined by this policy, and the encryption type option isn't presented in the BitLocker Setup Wizard.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

```xml
<enabled/><data id="OSEncryptionTypeDropDown_Name" value="1"/>
```

If this policy is disabled, the BitLocker Setup Wizard asks the user to select the encryption type before turning on BitLocker.

>[!Note]
>This policy is ignored when shrinking or expanding a volume, and the BitLocker driver uses the current encryption method.
>For example, when a drive that's using Used Space Only encryption is expanded, the new free space isn't wiped as it would be for a drive that uses Full encryption. The user could wipe the free space on a Used Space Only drive by using the following command: `manage-bde -w`. If the volume is shrunk, no action is taken for the new free space.

- GP ADMX file name: *VolumeEncryption.admx*

<!--/ADMXMapped-->

This setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires more authentication each time the computer starts and whether you're using BitLocker with or without a TPM. This setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

> [!NOTE]
> Only one of the additional authentication options is required at startup, otherwise an error occurs.

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, set the "ConfigureNonTPMStartupKeyUsage_Name" data. In this mode either a password or a USB drive is required for start-up. When using a startup key, the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted, the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable, or if you have forgotten the password, then you'll need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 6-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

> [!NOTE]
> In Windows 10, version 1703 release B, you can use a minimum PIN of 4 digits. SystemDrivesMinimumPINLength policy must be set to allow PINs shorter than 6 digits.

If you enable this policy setting, users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, users can configure only basic options on computers with a TPM.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

> [!NOTE]
> Devices that pass Hardware Security Testability Specification (HSTI) validation or Modern Standby devices won't be able to configure a Startup PIN using this CSP. Users are required to manually configure the PIN.

<!--/ADMXMapped-->

This setting allows you to configure a minimum length for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) startup PIN. This setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The startup PIN must have a minimum length of six digits and can have a maximum length of 20 digits.

> [!NOTE]
> In Windows 10, version 1703 release B, you can use a minimum PIN length of 4 digits.

>In TPM 2.0 if minimum PIN length is set below 6 digits, Windows will attempt to update the TPM lockout period to be greater than the default when a PIN is changed. If successful, Windows will only reset the TPM lockout period back to default if the TPM is reset. This doesn't apply to TPM 1.2.

If you enable this setting, you will require a minimum number of digits to set the startup PIN.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, users can configure a startup PIN of any length between 6 and 20 digits.

If you've previously configured a custom recovery message or URL and want to revert to the default message, you must keep the policy enabled and set the value "1" (Use default recovery message and URL).</o>

If you set the value to "2" (Use custom recovery message), the message you set in the "RecoveryMessage_Input" data field will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen. If a recovery URL is available, include it in the message.

If you set the value to "3" (Use custom recovery URL), the URL you type in the "RecoveryUrl_Input" data field will replace the default URL in the default recovery message, which will be displayed in the pre-boot key recovery screen.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

```xml
<enabled/><data id="PrebootRecoveryInfoDropDown_Name" value="xx"/><data id="RecoveryMessage_Input" value="yy"/><data id="RecoveryUrl_Input" value="zz"/>
```
<!--SupportedValues-->
The possible values for 'xx' are:

-  0 = Empty
-  1 = Use default recovery message and URL (in this case you don't need to specify a value for "RecoveryMessage_Input" or "RecoveryUrl_Input").
-  2 = Custom recovery message is set.
-  3 = Custom recovery URL is set.
-  'yy' = string of max length 900.
-  'zz' = string of max length 500.
<!--/SupportedValues-->
> [!NOTE]
> When you enable SystemDrivesRecoveryMessage, you must specify values for all three settings (pre-boot recovery screen, recovery message, and recovery URL), otherwise it will fail (500 return status). For example, if you only specify values for message and URL, you will get a 500 return status.

Disabling the policy will let the system choose the default behaviors.  If you want to disable this policy, use the following SyncML:

This setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of required startup key information. This setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The "OSAllowDRA_Name" (Allow certificate-based data recovery agent) data field is used to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent can be used, it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. For more information about adding data recovery agents, see [BitLocker recovery guide](/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-recovery-guide-plan).

In "OSRecoveryPasswordUsageDropDown_Name" and "OSRecoveryKeyUsageDropDown_Name" (Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information) set whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

Set "OSHideRecoveryPage_Name" (Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard) to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they turn on BitLocker on a drive. This setting means that you won't be able to specify which recovery option to use when you turn on BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

Set "OSActiveDirectoryBackup_Name" (Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services), to choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives (OSActiveDirectoryBackupDropDown_Name). If you set "1" (Backup recovery password and key package), both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you set "2" (Backup recovery password only), only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Set the "OSRequireActiveDirectoryBackup_Name" (Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives) data field if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

> [!NOTE]
> If the "OSRequireActiveDirectoryBackup_Name" (Don't enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives) data field is set, a recovery password is automatically generated.

If you enable this setting, you can control the methods available to users to recover data from BitLocker-protected operating system drives.

If this setting is disabled or not configured, the default recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA is allowed, the recovery options can be specified by the user including the recovery password and recovery key, and recovery information isn't backed up to AD DS.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker and controls whether fixed data drives utilize Used Space Only encryption or Full encryption. Setting this policy also causes the BitLocker Setup Wizard to skip the encryption options page, so no encryption selection is displayed to the user.

Changing the encryption type will have no effect if the drive is already encrypted or if encryption is in progress. Choose Full encryption to require that the entire drive be encrypted when BitLocker is turned on. Choose Used Space Only encryption to require only a portion of the drive that is used to store data is encrypted when BitLocker is turned on.

If you enable this policy setting, the encryption type that BitLocker uses to encrypt drives, and the encryption type option isn't presented in the BitLocker Setup Wizard.

Sample value for this node to enable this policy is:

```xml
<enabled/><data id="FDVEncryptionTypeDropDown_Name" value="1"/>

If this policy is disabled, the BitLocker Setup Wizard asks the user to select the encryption type before turning on BitLocker.

>[!Note]
>This policy is ignored when you're shrinking or expanding a volume and the BitLocker driver uses the current encryption method.
>For example, when a drive that's using Used Space Only encryption is expanded, the new free space isn't wiped as it would be for a drive that's using Full encryption. The user could wipe the free space on a Used Space Only drive by using the following command: `manage-bde -w`. If the volume is shrunk, no action is taken for the new free space.

This setting initiates a client-driven recovery password refresh after an OS drive recovery (either by using bootmgr or WinRE) and recovery password unlock on a Fixed data drive. This setting will refresh the specific recovery password that was used, and other unused passwords on the volume will remain unchanged. If the initialization of the refresh fails, the device will retry the refresh during the next reboot. When password refresh is initiated, the client will generate a new recovery password. The client will use the existing API in Azure AD to upload the new recovery key and retry on failure. After the recovery password has been successfully backed up to Azure AD, the recovery key that was used locally will be removed.

All recovery passwords for all drives will be refreshed and only one password per volume is retained. If errors occur, an error code will be returned so that server can take appropriate action to remediate.
<!--/Description-->

The client will generate a new recovery password. The client will use the existing API in Azure AD to upload the new recovery key and retry on failure.

Policy type is Execute. When “Execute Policy” is pushed, the client sets the status as Pending and initiates an asynchronous rotation operation. After refresh is complete, pass or fail status is updated. The client won't retry, but if needed, the server can reissue the execute request.

Server can call Get on the RotateRecoveryPasswordsRotationStatus node to query the status of the refresh.

Recovery password refresh will only occur for devices that are joined to Azure AD or joined to both Azure AD and on-premises (hybrid Azure AD-joined) that run a Windows 10 edition with the BitLocker CSP (Pro/Enterprise). Devices can't refresh recovery passwords if they're only registered in Azure AD (also known as workplace-joined) or signed in with a Microsoft account.

Each server-side recovery key rotation is represented by a request ID. The server can query the following nodes to make sure it reads status/result for same rotation request.
- RotateRecoveryPasswordsRequestID: Returns request ID of last request processed.
- RotateRecoveryPasswordsRotationStatus: Returns status of last request processed.

Supported values:

- 0 - Indicates that the device is compliant.
- Any non-zero value - Indicates that the device isn't compliant. This value represents a bitmask with each bit and the corresponding error code described in the following table:

| Bit | Error Code |
|-----|------------|
| 0 |The BitLocker policy requires user consent to launch the BitLocker Drive Encryption Wizard to start encryption of the OS volume, but the user didn't consent.|
| 1 |The encryption method of the OS volume doesn't match the BitLocker policy.|
| 2 |The OS volume is unprotected.|
| 3 |The BitLocker policy requires a TPM-only protector for the OS volume, but TPM protection is not used.|
| 4 |The BitLocker policy requires TPM+PIN protection for the OS volume, but a TPM+PIN protector is not used.|
| 5 |The BitLocker policy requires TPM+startup key protection for the OS volume, but a TPM+startup key protector is not used.|
| 6 |The BitLocker policy requires TPM+PIN+startup key protection for the OS volume, but a TPM+PIN+startup key protector is not used.|
| 7 |The BitLocker policy requires a TPM protector to protect the OS volume, but a TPM is not used.|
| 8 |Recovery key backup failed.|
| 9 |A fixed drive is unprotected.|
| 10 |The encryption method of the fixed drive doesn't match the BitLocker policy.|
| 11 |To encrypt drives, the BitLocker policy requires either the user to sign in as an Administrator or if the device is joined to Azure AD, the AllowStandardUserEncryption policy must be set to 1.|
| 12 |Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) isn't configured.|
| 13 |A TPM isn't available for BitLocker, either because it isn't present, it has been made unavailable in the Registry, or the OS is on a removable drive. |
| 14 |The TPM isn't ready for BitLocker.|
| 15 |The network isn't available, which is required for recovery key backup. |
| 16-31 |For future use.|
