The table below shows the applicability of Windows:

|Edition|Windows 10|Windows 11|

The eUICCs configuration service provider is used to support eUICC enterprise use cases and enables the IT admin to manage (assign, reassign, remove) subscriptions to employees. This CSP was added in windows 10, version 1709.

The following shows the eUICCs configuration service provider in tree format.

<a href="" id="--vendor-msft-euiccs"></a>**./Vendor/MSFT/eUICCs**
Root node for the eUICCs CSP.

<a href="" id="euicc"></a>**_eUICC_**
Interior node. Represents information associated with an eUICC. There's one subtree for each known eUICC, created by the Local Profile Assistant (LPA) when the eUICC is first seen. The node name is meaningful only to the LPA (which associates it with an eUICC ID (EID) in an implementation-specific manner, for example, this association could be an SHA-256 hash of the EID). The node name "Default" represents the currently active eUICC.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="euicc-identifier"></a>**_eUICC_/Identifier**
Required. Identifies an eUICC in an implementation-specific manner, for example, this identification could be an SHA-256 hash of the EID.

Supported operation is Get. Value type is string.

<a href="" id="euicc-isactive"></a>**_eUICC_/IsActive**
Required. Indicates whether this eUICC is physically present and active. Updated only by the LPA.

Supported operation is Get. Value type is boolean.

<a href="" id="euicc-ppr1allowed"></a>**_eUICC_/PPR1Allowed**
Profile Policy Rule 1 (PPR1) is required. Indicates whether the download of a profile with PPR1 is allowed. If the eUICC already has a profile (regardless of its origin and policy rules associated with it), the download of a profile with PPR1 isn't allowed.

Supported operation is Get.

Value type is boolean.

<a href="" id="euicc-ppr1alreadyset"></a>**_eUICC_/PPR1AlreadySet**
Required. Indicates whether the eUICC already has a profile with PPR1.

Supported operation is Get.

Value type is boolean.

<a href="" id="euicc-downloadservers"></a>**_eUICC_/DownloadServers**
Interior node. Represents default SM-DP+ discovery requests.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="euicc-downloadservers-servername"></a>**_eUICC_/DownloadServers/_ServerName_**
Interior node. Optional. Node specifying the server name for a discovery operation. The node name is the fully qualified domain name of the SM-DP+ server that will be used for profile discovery. Creation of this subtree triggers a discovery request.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Delete.

<a href="" id="euicc-downloadservers-servername-discoverystate"></a>**_eUICC_/DownloadServers/_ServerName_/DiscoveryState**
Required. Current state of the discovery operation for the parent ServerName (Requested = 1, Executing = 2, Completed = 3, Failed = 4). Queried by the CSP and only updated by the LPA.

Supported operation is Get.

Value type is integer. Default value is 1.

<a href="" id="euicc-downloadservers-servername-autoenable"></a>**_eUICC_/DownloadServers/_ServerName_/AutoEnable**
Required. Indicates whether the discovered profile must be enabled automatically after install. This setting must be defined by the MDM when the ServerName subtree is created.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Replace.

Value type is bool.

<a href="" id="euicc-downloadservers-servername-isdiscoveryserver"></a>**_eUICC_/DownloadServers/_ServerName_/IsDiscoveryServer**
Optional. Indicates whether the server is a discovery server. This setting must be defined by the MDM when the ServerName subtree is created.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Replace.

Value type is bool. Default value is false.

<a href="" id="euicc-profiles"></a>**_eUICC_/Profiles**
Interior node. Required. Represents all enterprise-owned profiles.

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="euicc-profiles-iccid"></a>**_eUICC_/Profiles/_ICCID_**
Interior node. Optional. Node representing an enterprise-owned eUICC profile. The node name is the ICCID of the profile (which is a unique identifier). Creation of this subtree triggers an AddProfile request by the LPA (which installs the profile on the eUICC). Removal of this subtree triggers the LPA to delete the profile (if resident on the eUICC).

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Delete.

<a href="" id="euicc-profiles-iccid-servername"></a>**_eUICC_/Profiles/_ICCID_/ServerName**
Required. Fully qualified domain name of the SM-DP+ that can download this profile. Must be set by the MDM when the ICCID subtree is created.

Supported operations are Add and Get.

Value type is string.

<a href="" id="euicc-profiles-iccid-matchingid"></a>**_eUICC_/Profiles/_ICCID_/MatchingID**
Required. Matching ID (activation code token) for profile download. Must be set by the MDM when the ICCID subtree is created.

Supported operations are Add and Get.

Value type is string.

<a href="" id="euicc-profiles-iccid-state"></a>**_eUICC_/Profiles/_ICCID_/State**
Required. Current state of the profile (Installing = 1, Installed = 2, Deleting = 3, Error = 4). Queried by the CSP and only updated by the LPA.

Supported operation is Get.

Value type is integer. Default value is 1.

<a href="" id="euicc-profiles-iccid-isenabled"></a>**_eUICC_/Profiles/_ICCID_/IsEnabled**
Added in Windows 10, version 1803. Indicates whether this profile is enabled. Can be set by the MDM when the ICCID subtree is created to enable the profile once itâ€™s successfully downloaded and installed on the device. Can also be queried and updated by the CSP.

Supported operations are Add, Get, and Replace.

Value type is bool.

<a href="" id="euicc-policies"></a>**_eUICC_/Policies**
Interior node. Required. Device policies associated with the eUICC as a whole (not per-profile).

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="euicc-policies-localuienabled"></a>**_eUICC_/Policies/LocalUIEnabled**
Required. Determines whether the local user interface of the LUI is available (true if available, false otherwise). Initially populated by the LPA when the eUICC tree is created, can be queried and changed by the MDM server.

Supported operations are Get and Replace.

Value type is boolean. Default value is true.

<a href="" id="euicc-actions"></a>**_eUICC_/Actions**
Interior node. Required. Actions that can be performed on the eUICC as a whole (when it's active).

Supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="euicc-actions-resettofactorystate"></a>**_eUICC_/Actions/ResetToFactoryState**
Required. An EXECUTE on this node triggers the  LPA to perform an eUICC Memory Reset.

Supported operation is Execute.

Value type is string.

<a href="" id="euicc-actions-status"></a>**_eUICC_/Actions/Status**
Required. Status of most recent operation, as an HRESULT. S_OK indicates success, S_FALSE indicates operation is in progress, other values represent specific errors.

Supported value is Get.

Value type is integer. Default is 0.
