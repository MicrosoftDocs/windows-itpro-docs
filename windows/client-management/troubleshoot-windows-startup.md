## How it works

When Microsoft Windows experiences a condition that compromises safe system operation, the system halts. These Windows startup problems are categorized in the following groups:
 
- Bug check: Also commonly known as a system crash, a kernel error, or a Stop error.

- No boot: The system may not produce a bug check but is unable to start up into Windows.

- Freeze: Also known as "system hang". 
  
## Best practices

To understand the underlying cause of Windows startup problems, it's important that the system be configured correctly. Here are some best practices for configuration:
