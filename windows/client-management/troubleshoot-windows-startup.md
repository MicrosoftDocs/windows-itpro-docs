# Advanced troubleshooting for Windows start-up issues

In these topics, you will learn how to troubleshoot common problems that are related to Windows startup.

## How it works

When Microsoft Windows experiences a condition that compromises safe system operation, the system halts. These Windows startup problems are categorized in the following groups:
 
- Bug check: Also commonly known as a system crash, a kernel error, or a Stop error.

- No boot: The system may not produce a bug check but is unable to start up into Windows.

- Freeze: Also known as "system hang". 
  
## Best practices

To understand the underlying cause of Windows startup problems, it's important that the system be configured correctly. Here are some best practices for configuration:
 
### Page file settings
 
- [Introduction of page file](introduction-page-file.md)

- [How to determine the appropriate page file size for 64-bit versions of Windows](determine-appropriate-page-file-size.md)
 
### Memory dump settings

- [Configure system failure and recovery options in Windows](system-failure-recovery-options.md)

- [Generate a kernel or complete crash dump](generate-kernel-or-complete-crash-dump.md)
