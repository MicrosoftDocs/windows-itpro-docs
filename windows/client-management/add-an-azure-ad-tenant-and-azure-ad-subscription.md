# Add an Azure AD tenant and Azure AD subscription

Here's a step-by-step guide to adding an Azure Active Directory tenant, adding an Azure AD subscription, and registering your subscription.

> **Note**  If you have paid subscriptions to Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Enterprise Mobility Suite, or other Microsoft services, you have a free subscription to Azure AD. For step-by-step guide to register this free subscription, see [Register your free Azure Active Directory subscription.](#register-your-free-azure-active-directory-subscription)


1. Sign up for Azure AD tenant from [this website](https://account.windowsazure.com/organization) by creating an administrator account for your organization.

5. After you finish creating your Azure account, you can add an Azure AD subscription.

   If you don't have a paid subscription to any Microsoft service, you can purchase an Azure AD premium subscription. Go to the Office 356 portal at https://portal.office.com/, and then sign in using the admin account that you created in Step 4 (for example, user1@contosoltd.onmicrosoftcom).
