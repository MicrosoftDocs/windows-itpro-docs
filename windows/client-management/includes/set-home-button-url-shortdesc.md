By default, Microsoft Edge shows the home button and loads the Start page, and locks down the home button to prevent users from changing what page loads. Enabling this policy loads a custom URL for the home button. When you enable this policy, and enable the Configure Home Button policy with the _Show home button & set a specific page_ option selected, a custom URL loads when the user clicks the home button.
