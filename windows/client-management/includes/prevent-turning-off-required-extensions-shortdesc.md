The Microsoft Edge browser allows users to uninstall extensions, by default. When the users work with extensions that come under a policy that is enabled, they can configure options for extensions defined in this policy, such as allowing InPrivate browsing. Any extra permissions requested by future updates of the extension get granted automatically. If - at this stage - you disable the policy, the list of extension package family names (PFNs) defined in this policy get ignored.
