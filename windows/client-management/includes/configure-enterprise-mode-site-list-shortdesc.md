Microsoft Edge does not support ActiveX controls, Browser Helper Objects, VBScript, or other legacy technology.  If you have sites or apps that use this technology, you can configure Microsoft Edge to check the Enterprise Mode Site List XML file that lists the sites and domains with compatibility issues and switch to IE11 automatically. You can use the same site list for both Microsoft Edge and IE11, or you can use separate lists. By default, Microsoft Edge ignores the Enterprise Mode and the Enterprise Mode Site List XML file. In this case, users might experience problems while using legacy apps. These sites and domains must be viewed using Internet Explorer 11 and Enterprise Mode.
