Microsoft Edge doesn't use a shared folder by default but downloads book files to a per-user folder for each user. With this policy, you can configure Microsoft Edge to store books from the Books Library to a default, shared folder in Windows, which decreases the amount of storage used by book files. When you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge downloads books to a shared folder after user action to download the book to their device, which allows them to remove downloaded books at any time. For this policy to work correctly, you must also enable the **Allow a Windows app to share application data between users** group policy.  Also, the users must be signed in with a school or work account.
