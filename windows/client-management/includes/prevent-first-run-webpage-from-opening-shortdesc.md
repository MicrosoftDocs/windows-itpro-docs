By default, when launching Microsoft Edge for the first time, the First Run webpage (a welcome page) hosted on Microsoft.com loads automatically via an FWLINK. The welcome page lists the new features and helpful tips of Microsoft Edge. With this policy, you can configure Microsoft Edge to prevent loading the welcome page on first explicit user-launch.
