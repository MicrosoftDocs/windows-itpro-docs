You can configure Microsoft Edge kiosk mode to reset to the configured start experience after a specified amount of idle time in minutes (0-1440). The reset timer begins after the last user interaction. Once the idle time meets the time specified, a confirmation message prompts the user to continue, and if no user action, Microsoft Edge kiosk mode resets after 30 seconds. Resetting to the configured start experience deletes the current userâ€™s browsing data.
