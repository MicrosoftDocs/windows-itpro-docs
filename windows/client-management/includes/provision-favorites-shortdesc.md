You can customize the Favorites list in the Microsoft Edge browser. Customization of the favorites list includes:

- Creating a standard list
    - This standard list includes:
        - Folders (which you can add)
        - the list of favorites that you manually add, after creating the standard list

This customized favorite is the final version. 

You can't add folders again for organizing, and adding or removing any of the favorites configured.
