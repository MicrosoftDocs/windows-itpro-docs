You can customize the Favorites list in the Microsoft Edge browser. Customization of the favorites list includes:

- Creating a standard list
    - This standard list includes:
        - Folders (which you can add)
        - the list of favorites that you manually add, after creating the standard list

This customized favorite is the final version.
