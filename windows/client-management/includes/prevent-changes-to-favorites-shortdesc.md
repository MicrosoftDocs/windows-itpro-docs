By default, users can add, import, and make changes to the Favorites list in Microsoft Edge. Enabling this policy locks down the Favorites list in Microsoft Edge, preventing users from making changes. When enabled, Microsoft Edge turns off the Save a Favorite, Import settings, and context menu items, such as Create a new folder. Enable only this policy or the Keep favorites in sync between Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge policy. If you enable both, Microsoft Edge prevents users from syncing their favorites between the two browsers.
