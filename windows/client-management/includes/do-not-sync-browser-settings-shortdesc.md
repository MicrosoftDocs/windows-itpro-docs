By default, the “browser” group syncs automatically between user’s devices and allowing users to choose to make changes.  The “browser” group uses the _Sync your Settings_ option in Settings to sync information like history and favorites. Enabling this policy prevents the “browser” group from using the Sync your Settings option.  If you want syncing turned off by default but not disabled, select the _Allow users to turn “browser” syncing_ option.
