By default, the “browser” group syncs automatically between the user’s devices, letting users make changes. With this policy, though, you can prevent the “browser” group from syncing and prevent users from turning on the _Sync your Settings_ toggle in Settings. If you want syncing turned off by default but not disabled, select the _Allow users to turn “browser” syncing_ option in the Do not sync browser policy. For this policy to work correctly, you must enable the Do not sync browser policy.
