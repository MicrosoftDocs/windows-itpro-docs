Microsoft Edge uses Windows Defender SmartScreen (turned on) to protect users from potential phishing scams and malicious software by default.  Also, by default, users can't disable (turn off) Windows Defender SmartScreen. Enabling this policy turns on Windows Defender SmartScreen and prevent users from turning it off.  Donâ€™t configure this policy to let users choose to turn Windows defender SmartScreen on or off.
