# Deciding Which Applications to Test


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows Server 2008 R2

Before starting your compatibility testing on the version of Windows that you want to deploy, you can use the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) to identify which applications should be the focus of your testing.

**To choose the applications to include in compatibility testing**

1.  Gather your application and device inventory. For more information, see [Taking Inventory of Your Organization](taking-inventory-of-your-organization.md).

2.  Use the Microsoft Compatibility Exchange to get the latest compatibility ratings. For more information, see [Sending and Receiving Compatibility Data](sending-and-receiving-compatibility-data.md).

3.  Organize and group your applications, and determine which applications need to be tested. For more information, see [Organizing Your Compatibility Data](organizing-your-compatibility-data.md).

    After completing these steps, you can then start creating and deploying your runtime-analysis packages to the test environment for your compatibility testing.
