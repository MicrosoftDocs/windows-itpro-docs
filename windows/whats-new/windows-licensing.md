## Use a Windows Pro device with the Windows Enterprise user subscription license

In most cases, the Windows Pro edition comes pre-installed on a business-class device.

With Windows 11 Enterprise E3, you can take advantage of features, services and use rights not licensed to the Windows Pro license bound to the device. It includes Windows Enterprise edition with cloud-powered capabilities and subscription use rights, and these capabilities are not always technically enforced. Some scenarios that may require to not upgrade to Windows Enterprise edition:

- Devices not properly provisioned that don't automatically upgrade to Windows Enterprise edition
- Devices may have been acquired for a business process that was not under control of a central IT department or outside of the IT department's knowledge
- Devices may be used temporarily for a project by vendors and added to the IT infrastructure, but not upgraded to Enterprise edition
- A developer that is developing applications that must be tested and certified on Pro, as that is how it will be delivered to customers
- A Windows Pro device that was pre-configured for a specific purpose and is certified on Pro only
