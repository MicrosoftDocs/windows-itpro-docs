# Windows client features lifecycle

Each release of Windows 10 and Windows 11 contains many new and improved features. Occasionally we also remove features and functionality, usually because there's a better option.

## Windows 11 features

For information about features that are impacted when you upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, see [Feature deprecations and removals](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications#table3).

## Features no longer being developed

The following article lists features that are no longer being developed. These features might be removed in a future release.

[Deprecated Windows features](deprecated-features.md)

## Features removed

The following article has details about features that have been removed from Windows 10 or Windows 11. This includes features that are present in Windows 10, but are removed in Windows 11.

## Terminology

The following terms can be used to describe the status that might be assigned to a feature during its lifecycle:

- **Deprecation**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a feature or functionality is no longer in active development and may be removed in future releases of a product or online service.
- **End of support**: The stage of the product lifecycle when support and servicing are no longer available for a product.
- **Retirement**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a service is shut down so that it's no longer available for use.
- **Remove or retire a feature**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a feature or functionality is taken out of a service after it has been marked as deprecated. The feature is removed from newer versions of Windows, but still exists in older versions and is supported until those versions reach **end of support** stage.
- **Replace a feature**: The stage of the product lifecycle when a feature or functionality in a service is replaced with a different feature or functionality.
