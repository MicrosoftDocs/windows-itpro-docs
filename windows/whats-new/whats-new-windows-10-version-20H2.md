# What's new in Windows 10, version 20H2 for IT Pros

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 20H2

This article lists new and updated features and content that is of interest to IT Pros for Windows 10, version 20H2, also known as the Windows 10 October 2020 Update. This update also contains all features and fixes included in previous cumulative updates to Windows 10, version 2004.

> [!NOTE]
> With this release and future releases, the Windows 10 release nomenclature is changing from a year and month pattern (YYMM) to a year and half-year pattern (YYH1, YYH2).

As with previous fall releases, Windows 10, version 20H2 is a scoped set of features for select performance improvements, enterprise features, and quality enhancements. As an [H2-targeted release](/lifecycle/faq/windows), 20H2 is serviced for 30 months from the release date for devices running Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Education editions. 

To download and install Windows 10, version 20H2, use Windows Update (**Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update**). For more information, including a video, see [How to get the Windows 10 October 2020 Update](https://community.windows.com/videos/how-to-get-the-windows-10-october-2020-update/7c7_mWN0wi8). 

## Microsoft Edge

This release automatically includes the new Chromium-based [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/business) browser instead of the legacy version of Edge.  For more information, see the [Microsoft Edge documentation](/microsoft-edge/).

## Servicing

### Windows Update

There are several changes that help improve the security of devices that scan Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for updates. For more information, see [Changes to improve security for Windows devices scanning WSUS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/changes-to-improve-security-for-windows-devices-scanning-wsus/ba-p/1645547).

Starting with Windows 10, version 20H2, LCUs and SSUs have been combined into a single cumulative monthly update, available via Microsoft Catalog or Windows Server Update Services. For more information, see [Simplifying on-premises deployment of servicing stack updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/simplifying-on-premises-deployment-of-servicing-stack-updates/ba-p/1646039).

## Deployment

New guidance is available to help prepare a [servicing strategy](/windows/deployment/update/waas-servicing-strategy-windows-10-updates) and move your devices to the latest version of Windows 10 quickly and as seamlessly as possible. 

Activities are grouped into the following phases: **Plan** > **Prepare** > **Deploy**:

**Plan** your deployment by evaluating and understanding essential activities: 
- Create a [phased deployment plan](/windows/deployment/update/create-deployment-plan)
- Assign [roles and responsibilities](/windows/deployment/update/plan-define-readiness#process-manager) within your organization
- Set [criteria](/windows/deployment/update/plan-define-readiness#set-criteria-for-rating-apps) to establish readiness for the upgrade process
- Evaluate your [infrastructure and tools](/windows/deployment/update/eval-infra-tools)
- Determine [readiness](/windows/deployment/update/plan-determine-app-readiness) for your business applications
- Create an effective, schedule-based [servicing strategy](/windows/deployment/update/plan-define-strategy)

**Prepare** your devices and environment for deployment by performing necessary actions:
- Update [infrastructure and tools](/windows/deployment/update/prepare-deploy-windows#prepare-infrastructure-and-environment)
- Ensure the needed [services](/windows/deployment/update/prepare-deploy-windows#prepare-applications-and-devices) are available
- Resolve issues with [unhealthy devices](/windows/deployment/update/prepare-deploy-windows#address-unhealthy-devices)
- Ensure that [users are ready](/windows/deployment/update/prepare-deploy-windows) for updates

**Deploy** and manage Windows 10 strategically in your organization:
- Use [Windows Autopilot](/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot) to streamline the setup, configuration, and delivery of new devices
- Use [Configuration Manager](/windows/deployment/deploy-windows-cm/prepare-for-zero-touch-installation-of-windows-10-with-configuration-manager) or [MDT](/windows/deployment/deploy-windows-mdt/prepare-for-windows-deployment-with-mdt) to deploy new devices and update existing devices
- Use [Windows Update for Business](/windows/deployment/update/waas-configure-wufb) with Group Policy to [customize update settings](/windows/deployment/update/waas-wufb-group-policy) for your devices
- [Deploy Windows updates](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wsus) with Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
- Manage bandwidth for updates with [Delivery Optimization](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization)
- [Monitor Windows Updates](/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-monitor) with Update Compliance

### Windows Autopilot

Enhancements to Windows Autopilot since the last release of Windows 10 include:
- [Windows Autopilot for HoloLens](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-autopilot-for-hololens-2/ba-p/1371494): Set up HoloLens 2 devices with Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 self-deploying mode.
- [Windows Autopilot with co-management](/mem/configmgr/comanage/quickstart-autopilot): Co-management and Autopilot together can help you reduce cost and improve the end user experience.
- Enhancements to Windows Autopilot deployment reporting are in preview. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Monitor** and scroll down to the **Enrollment** section. Select **Autopilot deployment (preview)**.

### Windows Assessment and Deployment Toolkit (ADK)

There's no new ADK for Windows 10, version 20H2. The ADK for Windows 10, version 2004 will also work with Windows 10, version 20H2.  For more information, see [Download and install the Windows ADK](/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install).

## Device management

Modern Device Management (MDM) policy is extended with new [Local Users and Groups settings](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-localusersandgroups) that match the options available for devices managed through Group Policy.

### Windows Hello
