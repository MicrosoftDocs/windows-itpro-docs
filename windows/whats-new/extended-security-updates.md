# Extended Security Updates (ESU) program for Windows 10

<!-- 8280171-->
The Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) program gives customers the option to receive security updates for PCs enrolled in the program. ESU is a paid program that provides individuals and organizations of all sizes with the option to extend the use of Windows 10 devices past the end of support date in a more secure manner. For more information about the Windows 10 lifecycle, see the [Windows Lifecycle FAQ](/lifecycle/faq/windows).

Individuals or organizations who elect to continue using Windows 10 after support ends on October 14, 2025, will have the option of enrolling their PCs into a paid ESU subscription. The ESU program enables PCs to continue to receive critical and important security updates through an annual subscription service after support ends. The [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://msrc.microsoft.com/) defines the [severity rating for security updates](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/security-update-severity-rating-system).


## Device prerequisites

To be eligible to install updates from the ESU program, devices must be running Windows 10, version 22H2.

## Limitations

ESUs doesn't include the following items:

- New features
- Customer-requested nonsecurity updates
- Design change requests
- General support won't be provided for Windows versions past the end of support date. Support will be available only to those organizations that purchase ESU for specific situations concerning the security updates. To get technical support, organizations must have an active [support plan](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise/services/unified-support-solutions) in place.

## Frequently asked questions

The following are frequently asked questions about the ESU program for Windows 10: 

### How much does ESU cost?

Final pricing and enrollment conditions will be made available closer to the October 2025 date for end of support, approximately one year before the end of support for Windows 10. ESU will be free for all Windows 365 customers. For more information about Windows 365, see [What is Windows 365?](/windows-365/overview).

### Is there a minimum license purchase requirement for Windows 10 ESU?

There are no minimum license purchase requirements for Windows 10 ESU.

### Can ESUs be purchased for a specific duration?

Customers can't buy partial periods, for instance, only six months. Extended Security Updates are transacted per year (12-month period), starting with the end of support date.

### When will the ESU offer be available for licensing?

Windows 10 ESU will be available in volume licensing starting about 12 months before the end of support date of Windows 10, or late 2024.

### How long can I get security updates for?

Enrolled PCs belonging to a commercial or educational organization can receive security updates for a maximum of three years after end of support for Windows 10.

### Is technical support included in ESU?

No, technical support isn't included in the ESU program. Microsoft will provide support for customers that encounter challenges related to the ESU. 

### Will Windows 10 PCs stop working without the ESU offering?

Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, but we recommend customers upgrade eligible PCs to Windows 11 using Windows Autopatch, Microsoft Intune, or transition to a new Windows 11 PC for the best, most secure computing experience. Customers also have the option to migrate to the cloud and subscribe to Windows 365 to make Windows 11 available to users on any device with a Cloud PC. Beginning October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide the following for versions of Windows 10 that reach end of support on that date:

- Technical support
- Feature updates or new features
- Quality updates (including security and reliability fixes)
