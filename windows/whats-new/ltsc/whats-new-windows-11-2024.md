| **Smart App Control** </br> [22H2][22H2] | Smart App Control adds significant protection from malware, including new and emerging threats, by blocking apps that are malicious or untrusted. Smart App Control helps block unwanted apps that affect performance, display unexpected ads, offer extra software you didn't want, and other things you don't expect. For more information, see [Smart App Control](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control#wdac-and-smart-app-control). |
| **Credential Guard** </br> [22H2][22H2] | Credential Guard, enabled by default, uses Virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks like pass the hash and pass the ticket. For more information, see [Configure Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/configure).|
| **Malicious and vulnerable driver blocking** </br> [22H2][22H2] | The vulnerable driver blocklist is automatically enabled on devices when Smart App Control is enabled and for clean installs of Windows.

| **Local Security Authority (LSA) protection enablement** </br> [24H2][24H2]| An audit occurs for incompatibilities with [LSA protection](/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection) for a period of time, starting with this upgrade. If incompatibilities aren't detected, LSA protection is automatically enabled. You can check and change the enablement state of LSA protection in the Windows Security application under the **Device Security** > **Core Isolation** page. In the event log, [LSA protection logs](/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection#identify-plug-ins-and-drivers-that-lsassexe-fails-to-load) whether programs are blocked from loading into LSA. |
| **Rust in the Windows kernel** </br> [24H2][24H2] | There's a new implementation of [GDI region](/windows/win32/gdi/regions) in `win32kbase_rs.sys`. Since Rust offers advantages in reliability and security over traditional programs written in C/C++, you'll continue to see more use of it in the kernel. |
| **SHA-3 support** </br> [24H2][24H2] | Support for the SHA-3 family of hash functions and SHA-3 derived functions (SHAKE, cSHAKE, KMAC) was added. The SHA-3 family of algorithms is the latest standardized hash functions by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Support for these functions is enabled through the Windows [CNG](/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal) library. | 
| **Windows Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS)** </br> [24H2][24H2] | Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) is a Windows feature that automatically manages and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Microsoft Entra joined or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices. Windows LAPS is the successor for the now deprecated legacy Microsoft LAPS product. For more information, see [What is Windows LAPS?](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview)|
| **Windows&nbsp;LAPS** </br> Automatic account management </br> [24H2][24H2] | [Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) has a new automatic account management feature. Admins can configure Windows LAPS to:</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Automatically create the managed local account</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Configure name of account</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Enable or disable the account</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Randomize the name of the account |
| **Windows&nbsp;LAPS** </br> Policy improvements </br> [24H2][24H2]| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Added passphrase settings for the [PasswordComplexity](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiespasswordcomplexity) policy </br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Use [PassphraseLength](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiespassphraselength) to control the number of words in a new passphrase </br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Added an improved readability setting for the [PasswordComplexity](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiespasswordcomplexity) policy, which generates passwords without using characters that are easily confused with another character. For example, the number <kbd>0</kbd> and the letter <kbd>O</kbd> aren't used in the password since the characters can be confused. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Added the `Reset the password, logoff the managed account, and terminate any remaining processes` setting to the [PostAuthenticationActions](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiespostauthenticationactions) policy. The event logging messages that are emitted during post-authentication-action execution were also expanded, to give insights into exactly what was done during the operation. |
| **Windows&nbsp;LAPS** </br> Image rollback detection </br> [24H2][24H2] | Image rollback detection was introduced for LAPS. LAPS can detect when a device was rolled back to a previous image. When a device is rolled back, the password in Active Directory might not match the password on the device that was rolled back. This new feature adds an Active Directory attribute, `msLAPS-CurrentPasswordVersion`, to the [Windows LAPS schema](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-technical-reference#mslaps-currentpasswordversion). This attribute contains a random GUID that Windows LAPS writes every time a new password is persisted in Active Directory, followed by saving a local copy. During every processing cycle, the GUID stored in `msLAPS-CurrentPasswordVersion` is queried and compared to the locally persisted copy. If the GUIDs are different, the password is immediately rotated. To enable this feature, you need to run the latest version of the [Update-LapsADSchema PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/laps/update-lapsadschema). |
| **Windows protected print mode** </br> [24H2][24H2] | Windows protected print mode (WPP) enables a modern print stack which is designed to work exclusively with [Mopria certified printers](https://mopria.org/certified-products). For more information, see [What is Windows protected print mode (WPP)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/a-new-modern-and-secure-print-experience-from-windows/ba-p/4002645) and [Windows Insider WPP announcement](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/12/13/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26016-canary-channel/). |
| **SMB signing requirement changes** </br> [24H2][24H2] | [SMB signing is now required](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-signing) by default for all connections. SMB signing ensures every message contains a signature generated using session key and cipher suite. The client puts a hash of the entire message into the signature field of the SMB header. If anyone changes the message itself later on the wire, the hash won't match and SMB knows that someone tampered with the data. It also confirms to sender and receiver that they are who they say they are, breaking relay attacks. For more information about SMB signing being required by default, see [https://aka.ms/SMBSigningOBD](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-signing-required-by-default-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3831704). |
| **SMB client encryption** </br> [24H2][24H2] | SMB now supports [requiring encryption](/windows-server/storage/file-server/configure-smb-client-require-encryption) on all outbound SMB client connections. Encryption of all outbound SMB client connections enforces the highest level of network security and brings management parity to SMB signing, which allows both client and server requirements. With this new option, administrators can mandate that all destination servers use SMB 3 and encryption, and if missing those capabilities, the client won't connect. For more information about this change, see [https://aka.ms/SmbClientEncrypt](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-client-encryption-mandate-now-supported-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3964037). |
| **SMB signing and encryption auditing** </br> [24H2][24H2] | Administrators can now [enable auditing](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-signing-overview#smb-signing-and-encryption-auditing) of the SMB server and client for support of SMB signing and encryption. This shows if a third-party client or server doesn't support SMB encryption or signing. The SMB signing and encryption auditing settings can be modified in Group Policy or through PowerShell. |
| **SMB alternative client and server ports** </br> [24H2][24H2] | The SMB client now supports connecting to an SMB server over TCP, QUIC, or RDMA using [alternative network ports](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-ports) to the hardcoded defaults. However, you can only connect to alternative ports if the SMB server is configured to support listening on that port. Starting in [Windows Server Insider build 26040](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server-insiders/announcing-windows-server-preview-build-26040/m-p/4040858), the SMB server now supports listening on an alternative network port for SMB over QUIC. Windows Server doesn't support configuring alternative SMB server TCP ports, but some third parties do. For more information about this change, see [https://aka.ms/SMBAlternativePorts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-alternative-ports-now-supported-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3974509). |
| **SMB NTLM blocking exception list** </br> [24H2][24H2] |The SMB client now supports [blocking NTLM](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-ntlm-blocking) for remote outbound connections. With this new option, administrators can intentionally block Windows from offering NTLM via SMB and specify exceptions for NTLM usage. An attacker who tricks a user or application into sending NTLM challenge responses to a malicious server will no longer receive any NTLM data and can't brute force, crack, or pass hashes. This change adds a new level of protection for enterprises without a requirement to entirely disable NTLM usage in the OS. For more information about this change, see [https://aka.ms/SmbNtlmBlock](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-ntlm-blocking-now-supported-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3916206). |
| **SMB dialect management** </br> [24H2][24H2] | The SMB server now supports controlling which [SMB 2 and 3 dialects](/windows-server/storage/file-server/manage-smb-dialects) it negotiates. With this new option, an administrator can remove specific SMB protocols from use in the organization, blocking older, less secure, and less capable Windows devices and third parties from connecting. For example, admins can specify to only use SMB 3.1.1, the most secure dialect of the protocol. For more information about this change, see [https://aka.ms/SmbDialectManage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-dialect-management-now-supported-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3916368).| 
| **SMB over QUIC client access control** </br> [24H2][24H2] | [SMB over QUIC](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-over-quic), which introduced an alternative to TCP and RDMA, supplies secure connectivity to edge file servers over untrusted networks like the Internet. QUIC has significant advantages, the largest being mandatory certificate-based encryption instead of relying on passwords. SMB over QUIC [client access control](/windows-server/storage/file-server/configure-smb-over-quic-client-access-control) improves the existing SMB over QUIC feature. Administrators now have more options for SMB over QUIC such as: </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• [Specifying which clients](/windows-server/storage/file-server/configure-smb-over-quic-client-access-control#grant-individual-clients) can access SMB over QUIC servers. This gives organizations more protection but doesn't change the Windows authentication used to make the SMB connection or the end user experience. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• [Disabling SMB over QUIC](/windows-server/storage/file-server/configure-smb-over-quic-client-access-control#disable-smb-over-quic) for client with Group Policy and PowerShell </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• [Auditing client connection events](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-over-quic#smb-over-quic-client-auditing) for SMB over QUIC </br></br> For more information about these changes, see [https://aka.ms/SmbOverQUICCAC](/windows-server/storage/file-server/configure-smb-over-quic-client-access-control). |
| **SMB firewall rule changes** </br> [24H2][24H2] | The Windows Firewall [default behavior has changed](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-secure-traffic#updated-firewall-rules-preview). Previously, creating an SMB share automatically configured the firewall to enable the rules in the **File and Printer Sharing** group for the given firewall profiles. Now, Windows automatically configures the new **File and Printer Sharing (Restrictive)** group, which no longer contains inbound NetBIOS ports 137-139. </br></br> This change enforces a higher degree of default of network security and brings SMB firewall rules closer to the Windows Server **File Server** role behavior, which only opens the minimum ports needed to connect and manage sharing. Administrators can still configure the **File and Printer Sharing** group if necessary as well as modify this new firewall group, these are just default behaviors. For more information about this change, see [https://aka.ms/SMBfirewall](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-firewall-rule-changes-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3974496).
