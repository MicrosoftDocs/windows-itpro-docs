> [!NOTE]
> The long-term servicing channel was previously called the long-term servicing branch (LTSB). All references to LTSB are changed in this article to LTSC for consistency, even though the name of previous versions might still be displayed as LTSB.

With the LTSC servicing model, you can delay receiving *feature* updates and instead only receive monthly *quality* updates on devices. Features from Windows 10 that could be updated with new functionality, including Microsoft Edge and in-box Windows apps, are also not included. Feature updates are offered in new LTSC releases every several years instead of every few months. You can choose to install them as in-place upgrades, or even skip releases, what's best for your business requirements. Microsoft is committed to providing bug fixes and security patches for each LTSC release during the extended LTSC servicing lifecycle. Always check your individual LTSC release to verify its servicing lifecycle. For more information, see [release information](/windows/release-health/release-information), or search the [product lifecycle information](/lifecycle/products/) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The long-term servicing channel isn't intended for deployment on most or all the PCs in an organization. The LTSC edition of Windows 10 provides a deployment option for special-purpose devices and environments. These devices typically do a single important task and don't need feature updates as frequently as other devices in the organization. These devices are also typically not heavily dependent on support from external apps and tools. Since the feature set for LTSC doesn't change for the lifetime of the release, over time there might be some external tools that don't continue to provide legacy support. For more information, see [LTSC: What is it, and when it should be used](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/LTSC-What-is-it-and-when-should-it-be-used/ba-p/293181).
