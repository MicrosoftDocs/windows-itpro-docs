# Edit an existing topic using the Contribute link
You can now make suggestions and update existing, public content with a GitHub account and a simple click of a link.

**To edit a topic**

1. All contributors who are ***not*** a Microsoft employee must [sign a Microsoft Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.microsoft.com/) before contributing to any Microsoft repositories. 
If you've already contributed to Microsoft repositories in the past, congratulations! 
You've already completed this step.

2. Go to the page on TechNet that you want to update, and then click **Contribute**.
