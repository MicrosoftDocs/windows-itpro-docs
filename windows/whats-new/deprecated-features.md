# Deprecated features for Windows client

Each version of Windows client adds new features and functionality. Occasionally, new versions also remove features and functionality, often because they've added a newer option. This article provides details about the features and functionalities that are no longer being developed in Windows client. For more information about features that have been removed, see [Windows features removed](removed-features.md).

For more information about features in Windows 11, see [Feature deprecations and removals](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications#table3).

To understand the distinction between *deprecation* and *removal*, see [Windows client features lifecycle](feature-lifecycle.md).

The features in this article are no longer being actively developed, and might be removed in a future update. Some features have been replaced with other features or functionality and some are now available from other sources.

## Deprecated features

**The following list is subject to change and might not include every affected feature or functionality.**

In a future release, any connection to a Wi-Fi network using these old ciphers will be disallowed. Wi-Fi routers should be updated to use AES ciphers, available with WPA2 or WPA3. | 1903 |
| Windows To Go | Windows To Go is no longer being developed. <br><br>The feature doesn't support feature updates and therefore doesn't enable you to stay current. It also requires a specific type of USB that is no longer supported by many OEMs.|  1903 |
| Print 3D app | 3D Builder is the recommended 3D printing app. To 3D print objects on new Windows devices, customers must first install 3D Builder from the Store.| 1903 |
|Companion device dynamic lock APIS|The companion device framework (CDF) APIs enable wearables and other devices to unlock a PC. In Windows 10, version 1709, we introduced [Dynamic Lock](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-feature-dynamic-lock), including an inbox method using Bluetooth to detect whether a user is present and lock or unlock the PC. Because of this reason, and because non-Microsoft partners didn't adopt the CDF method, we're no longer developing CDF Dynamic Lock APIs.| 1809 |
|OneSync service|The OneSync service synchronizes data for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps. We've added a sync engine to the Outlook app that provides the same synchronization.| 1809 |
|[Software Restriction Policies](/windows-server/identity/software-restriction-policies/software-restriction-policies) in Group Policy|Instead of using the Software Restriction Policies through Group Policy, you can use [AppLocker](/windows/security/threat-protection/applocker/applocker-overview) or [Windows Defender Application Control](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control) to control which apps users can access and what code can run in the kernel.| 1803 |
|[Offline symbol packages](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-symbols) (Debug symbol MSIs)|We're no longer making the symbol packages available as a downloadable MSI. Instead, the [Microsoft Symbol Server is moving to be an Azure-based symbol store](/archive/blogs/windbg/update-on-microsofts-symbol-server). If you need the Windows symbols, connect to the Microsoft Symbol Server to cache your symbols locally or use a manifest file with SymChk.exe on a computer with internet access.| 1803 |
|Windows Help Viewer (WinHlp32.exe)|All Windows help information is [available online](https://support.microsoft.com/products/windows?os=windows-10).

|Phone Companion|Use the **Phone** page in the Settings app. In Windows 10, version 1709, we added the new **Phone** page to help you sync your mobile phone with your PC. It includes all the Phone Companion features.| 1803 |
|IPv4/6 Transition Technologies (6to4, ISATAP, Teredo, and Direct Tunnels)|6to4 has been disabled by default since Windows 10, version 1607 (the Anniversary Update), ISATAP has been disabled by default since Windows 10, version 1703 (the Creators Update), Teredo has been disabled since Windows 10, version 1803. The Direct Tunnels feature has always been disabled by default. Use native IPv6 support instead.| 1803 |
|[Layered Service Providers](/windows/win32/winsock/categorizing-layered-service-providers-and-applications)|Layered Service Providers haven't been developed since Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Use the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page) instead. When you upgrade from an older version of Windows, any layered service providers you're using aren't migrated; you'll need to reinstall them after upgrading.| 1803 |
|Business Scanning| This feature is also called Distributed Scan Management (DSM) **(Added 05/03/2018)**<br>&nbsp;<br>The [Scan Management functionality](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd759124(v=ws.11)) was introduced in Windows 7 and enabled secure scanning and the management of scanners in an enterprise.

|System Image Backup (SIB) Solution|This feature is also known as the **Backup and Restore (Windows 7)** legacy control panel. For full-disk backup solutions, look for a third-party product from another software vendor. You can also use [OneDrive](/onedrive/) to sync data files with Microsoft 365.| 1709 |
|TLS RC4 Ciphers  |To be disabled by default. For more information, see [TLS (Schannel SSP) changes in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-schannel-ssp-changes-in-windows-10-and-windows-server)| 1709 |
|Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Owner Password Management |This functionality within TPM.msc will be migrated to a new user interface.| 1709 |
|Trusted Platform Module (TPM): TPM.msc and TPM Remote Management  | To be replaced by a new user interface in a future release. | 1709 |
|Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Remote Management |This functionality within TPM.msc will be migrated to a new user interface. | 1709 |
|Windows Hello for Business deployment that uses Microsoft Configuration Manager   |Windows Server 2016 Active Directory Federation Services - Registration Authority (ADFS RA) deployment is simpler and provides a better user experience and a more deterministic certificate enrollment experience. | 1709 |
|Windows PowerShell 2.0  | Applications and components should be migrated to PowerShell 5.0+. | 1709 |
|Apndatabase.xml | Apndatabase.xml is being replaced by the COSA database. Therefore, some constructs will no longer function.

|IPsec Task Offload| [IPsec Task Offload](/windows-hardware/drivers/network/task-offload) versions 1 and 2 are no longer being developed and shouldn't be used. | 1703 |
|`wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:####### /quiet`|The `wusa` tool usage to quietly uninstall an update has been deprecated. The uninstall command with `/quiet` switch fails with event ID 8 in the Setup event log. Uninstalling updates quietly could be a security risk because malicious software could quietly uninstall an update in the background without user intervention.|1507 <br /> Applies to Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019.|
