# Deprecated features for Windows client

Each version of Windows client adds new features and functionality. Occasionally, new versions also remove features and functionality, often because they added a newer option. This article provides details about the features and functionalities that are no longer being developed in Windows client.<!-- this sentence is used by tip for RSS --> For more information about features that were removed, see [Windows features removed](removed-features.md).

For more information about features in Windows 11, see [Feature deprecations and removals](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications#table3).

To understand the distinction between *deprecation* and *removal*, see [Windows client features lifecycle](feature-lifecycle.md).

The features in this article are no longer being actively developed, and might be removed in a future update. Some features were replaced with other features or functionality and some are now available from other sources.

| Feature | Details and mitigation  | Deprecation announced |
|---|---|---|
| DirectAccess <!--8713507-->| DirectAccess is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. We recommend [migrating from DirectAccess to Always On VPN](/windows-server/remote/remote-access/da-always-on-vpn-migration/da-always-on-migration-overview). | June 2024 | 
| NTLM <!--8396018-->| All versions of [NTLM](/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm), including LANMAN, NTLMv1, and NTLMv2, are no longer under active feature development and are deprecated. Use of NTLM will continue to work in the next release of Windows Server and the next annual release of Windows. Calls to NTLM should be replaced by calls to Negotiate, which will try to authenticate with Kerberos and only fall back to NTLM when necessary. For more information, see [Resources for deprecated features](deprecated-features-resources.md). | June 2024 |
| Driver Verifier GUI (verifiergui.exe) <!--8995057--> | Driver Verifier GUI, verifiergui.exe, is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Windows. You can use the [Verifier Command Line](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/verifier-command-line) (verifier.exe) instead of the Driver Verifier GUI.| May 2024 | 
| NPLogonNotify and NPPasswordChangeNotify APIs <!--8787264--> | Starting in Windows 11, version 24H2, the inclusion of password payload in MPR notifications is set to disabled by default through group policy in [NPLogonNotify](/windows/win32/api/npapi/nf-npapi-nplogonnotify) and [NPPasswordChangeNotify](/windows/win32/api/npapi/nf-npapi-nppasswordchangenotify) APIs. The APIs may be removed in a future release. The primary reason for disabling this feature is to enhance security. When enabled, these APIs allow the caller to retrieve a user's password, presenting potential risks for password exposure and harvesting by malicious users. To include password payload in MPR notifications, set the [EnableMPRNotifications](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-windowslogon#enablemprnotifications) policy to `enabled`.| March 2024 |
| TLS server authentication certificates using RSA keys with key lengths shorter than 2048 bits <!--8644149-->| Support for certificates using RSA keys with key lengths shorter than 2048 bits will be deprecated. Internet standards and regulatory bodies disallowed the use of 1024-bit keys in 2013, recommending specifically that RSA keys should have a key length of 2048 bits or longer. For more information, see [Transitioning of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes - Discussion Paper (nist.gov)](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Key-Management/documents/transitions/Transitioning_CryptoAlgos_070209.pdf). This deprecation focuses on ensuring that all RSA certificates used for TLS server authentication must have key lengths greater than or equal to 2048 bits to be considered valid by Windows. </br></br> TLS certificates issued by enterprise or test certification authorities (CA) aren't impacted with this change. However, we recommend that they be updated to RSA keys greater than or equal to 2048 bits as a security best practice. This change is necessary to preserve security of Windows customers using certificates for authentication and cryptographic purposes.| March 2024|
| Test Base <!--8790681--> | [Test Base for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/test-base/overview), an Azure cloud service for application testing, is deprecated. The service will be retired in the future and will be no longer available for use after retirement. | March 2024 |
| Windows Mixed Reality <!--8412877--> | [Windows Mixed Reality](/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/before-you-start) is deprecated and will be removed in Windows 11, version 24H2. This deprecation includes the [Mixed Reality Portal](/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/install-windows-mixed-reality) app, [Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR](/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/using-steamvr-with-windows-mixed-reality), and Steam VR Beta. Existing Windows Mixed Reality devices will continue to work with Steam through November 2026, if users remain on their current released version of Windows 11, version 23H2. After November 2026, Windows Mixed Reality will no longer receive security updates, nonsecurity updates, bug fixes, technical support, or online technical content updates.</br> </br>This deprecation doesn't affect HoloLens. We remain committed to HoloLens and our enterprise customers. | December 2023 |
| Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Edge <!--8591267-->| [Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview), including the [Windows Isolated App Launcher APIs](/windows/win32/api/isolatedapplauncher/), is being deprecated for Microsoft Edge for Business and [will no longer be updated](feature-lifecycle.md). Please download the [Microsoft Edge For Business Security Whitepaper](https://edgestatic.azureedge.net/shared/cms/pdfs/Microsoft_Edge_Security_Whitepaper_v2.pdf) to learn more about Edge for Business security capabilities. </br></br> **[Update - April 2024]**: Because Application Guard is deprecated there will not be a migration to Edge Manifest V3. The corresponding extensions and associated Windows Store app will not be available after May 2024. This affects the following browsers: *Application Guard Extension - Chrome* and *Application Guard Extension - Firefox*. If you want to block unprotected browsers until you are ready to retire MDAG usage in your enterprise, we recommend using AppLocker policies or [Microsoft Edge management service](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-management-service). For more information, see [Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard). <!--8932292-->| December 2023 |
| Legacy console mode <!-- 8577271 -->| The [legacy console mode](/windows/console/legacymode) is deprecated and no longer being updated. In future Windows releases, it will be available as an optional [Feature on Demand](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities). This feature won't be installed by default. | December 2023 |
| Windows speech recognition <!--8396142-->| [Windows speech recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571) is  deprecated and is no longer being developed. This feature is being replaced with [voice access](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/4dcd23ee-f1b9-4fd1-bacc-862ab611f55d). Voice access is available for Windows 11, version 22H2, or later devices.

| Computer Browser <!--8454292-->| The Computer Browser driver and service are deprecated. The browser (browser protocol and service) is a dated and insecure device location protocol. This protocol, service, and driver were first disabled by default in Windows 10 with the removal of the SMB1 service. For more information on Computer Browser, see [MS-BRWS Common Internet File System](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-brws/3cfbad92-09b3-4abc-808f-c6f6347d5677). | November 2023 |
| Webclient (WebDAV) Service <!--8454308--> | The Webclient (WebDAV) service is deprecated. The Webclient service isn't started by default in Windows. For more information on WebDAV, see [WebDAV - Win32 apps](/windows/win32/webdav/webdav-portal). | November 2023 |
| Remote Mailslots <!--8454244-->| Remote Mailslots are deprecated. The Remote Mailslot protocol is a dated, simple, unreliable, insecure IPC method first introduced in MS DOS. This protocol was first disabled by default in [Windows 11 Insider Preview Build ](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25314/). For more information on Remote Mailslots, see [About Mailslots](/windows/win32/ipc/about-mailslots) and [[MS-MAIL]: Remote Mailslot Protocol](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-mail/8ea19aa4-6e5a-4aed-b628-0b5cd75a1ab9).| November 2023 |
| Timeline for Microsoft Entra accounts <!--8396095--> | Cross-device syncing of Microsoft Entra user activity history will stop starting in January 2024. Microsoft will stop storing this data in the cloud, aligning with [the previous change for Microsoft accounts (MSA)](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21359) in 2021. The timeline user experience was retired in Windows 11, although it remains in Windows 10. The timeline user experience and all your local activity history still remains on Windows 10 devices. Users can access web history using their browser and access recent files through OneDrive and Office. | October 2023 |
| VBScript <!--7954828--> | VBScript is deprecated. In future releases of Windows, VBScript will be available as a feature on demand before its removal from the operating system. For more information, see [Resources for deprecated features](deprecated-features-resources.md#vbscript). | October 2023 |
| WordPad | WordPad is no longer being updated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. We recommend Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt. </br></br> **[Update - March 2024]**: WordPad will be removed from all editions of Windows starting in Windows 11, version 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. If you're a developer and need information about the affected binaries, see [Resources for deprecated features](deprecated-features-resources.md#wordpad). | September 1, 2023 |
| AllJoyn |  Microsoft's implementation of AllJoyn, which included the [Windows.Devices.AllJoyn API namespace](/uwp/api/windows.devices.alljoyn), a [Win32 API](/windows/win32/api/_alljoyn/), a [management configuration service provider (CSP)](/windows/client-management/mdm/alljoynmanagement-csp), and an [Alljoyn Router Service](/windows-server/security/windows-services/security-guidelines-for-disabling-system-services-in-windows-server#alljoyn-router-service) is deprecated. [AllJoyn](https://openconnectivity.org/technology/reference-implementation/alljoyn/), sponsored by AllSeen Alliance, was an open source discovery and communication protocol for Internet of Things scenarios such as turning on/off lights or reading temperatures.AllSeen Alliance promoted the AllJoyn project from 2013 until 2016 when it merged with the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), the sponsors of [Iotivity.org](https://iotivity.org/), another protocol for Internet of Things scenarios. Customers should refer to the [Iotivity.org](https://iotivity.org/) website for alternatives such as [Iotivity Lite](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite) or [Iotivity](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity).  | August 17, 2023 |
| TLS 1.0 and 1.1 | Over the past several years, internet standards and regulatory bodies have [deprecated or disallowed](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8996.html) TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 due to various security issues. Starting in Windows 11 Insider Preview builds for September 2023 and continuing in future Windows OS releases, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 will be disabled by default. This change increases the security posture of Windows customers and encourages modern protocol adoption. For organizations that need to use these versions, there's an option to re-enable TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1. For more information, see [Resources for deprecated features](deprecated-features-resources.md). | August 1, 2023|
| Cortana in Windows <!--7987543--> | Cortana in Windows as a standalone app is deprecated.

| Wi-Fi WEP and TKIP | Since the 1903 release, a warning message has appeared when connecting to Wi-Fi networks secured with WEP or TKIP (which aren't as secure as those using WPA2 or WPA3). In a future release, any connection to a Wi-Fi network using these old ciphers will be disallowed. Wi-Fi routers should be updated to use AES ciphers, available with WPA2 or WPA3. | 1903 |
| Print 3D app | 3D Builder is the recommended 3D printing app. To 3D print objects on new Windows devices, customers must first install 3D Builder from the Store.| 1903 |
|Companion device dynamic lock APIS|The companion device framework (CDF) APIs enable wearables and other devices to unlock a PC. In Windows 10, version 1709, we introduced [Dynamic Lock](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-feature-dynamic-lock), including an inbox method using Bluetooth to detect whether a user is present and lock or unlock the PC. Because of this reason, and because non-Microsoft partners didn't adopt the CDF method, we're no longer developing CDF Dynamic Lock APIs.| 1809 |
|OneSync service|The OneSync service synchronizes data for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps. We added a sync engine to the Outlook app that provides the same synchronization.| 1809 |
|[Software Restriction Policies](/windows-server/identity/software-restriction-policies/software-restriction-policies) in Group Policy|Instead of using the Software Restriction Policies through Group Policy, you can use [AppLocker](/windows/security/threat-protection/applocker/applocker-overview) or [Windows Defender Application Control](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control) to control which apps users can access and what code can run in the kernel.| 1803 |
|[Offline symbol packages](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-symbols) (Debug symbol MSIs)|We're no longer making the symbol packages available as a downloadable MSI. Instead, the [Microsoft Symbol Server is moving to be an Azure-based symbol store](/archive/blogs/windbg/update-on-microsofts-symbol-server). If you need the Windows symbols, connect to the Microsoft Symbol Server to cache your symbols locally or use a manifest file with SymChk.exe on a computer with internet access.| 1803 |
|Windows Help Viewer (WinHlp32.exe)|All Windows help information is [available online](https://support.microsoft.com/products/windows?os=windows-10). The Windows Help Viewer is no longer supported in Windows 10. For more information, see [Error opening Help in Windows-based programs: "Feature not included" or "Help not supported"](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/error-opening-help-in-windows-based-programs-feature-not-included-or-help-not-supported-3c841463-d67c-6062-0ee7-1a149da3973b).| 1803 |
|MBAE service metadata|The MBAE app experience is replaced by an MO UWP app. For more information, see [Developer guide for creating service metadata](/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/developer-guide-for-creating-service-metadata) | 1803 |
|Contacts feature in File Explorer|We're no longer developing the Contacts feature or the corresponding [Windows Contacts API](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wincontacts/-wincontacts-entry-point). Instead, you can use the People app in Windows 10 to maintain your contacts.| 1803 |
|Phone Companion|Use the **Phone** page in the Settings app. In Windows 10, version 1709, we added the new **Phone** page to help you sync your mobile phone with your PC. It includes all the Phone Companion features.| 1803 |
|IPv4/6 Transition Technologies (6to4, ISATAP, Teredo, and Direct Tunnels)|6to4 has been disabled by default since Windows 10, version 1607 (the Anniversary Update), ISATAP has been disabled by default since Windows 10, version 1703 (the Creators Update), Teredo has been disabled since Windows 10, version 1803. The Direct Tunnels feature has always been disabled by default. Use native IPv6 support instead.| 1803 |
|[Layered Service Providers](/windows/win32/winsock/categorizing-layered-service-providers-and-applications)|Layered Service Providers haven't been developed since Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Use the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page) instead. When you upgrade from an older version of Windows, any layered service providers you're using aren't migrated; you'll need to reinstall them after upgrading.| 1803 |
|Business Scanning| This feature is also called Distributed Scan Management (DSM) **(Added 05/03/2018)**<br>&nbsp;<br>The [Scan Management functionality](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd759124(v=ws.11)) was introduced in Windows 7 and enabled secure scanning and the management of scanners in an enterprise. We're no longer investing in this feature, and there are no devices available that support it.| 1803 |
|IIS 6 Management Compatibility*  | We recommend that users use alternative scripting tools and a newer management console. | 1709 |
|IIS Digest Authentication | We recommend that users use alternative authentication methods.| 1709 |
|RSA/AES Encryption for IIS   | We recommend that users use CNG encryption provider. | 1709 |
|Screen saver functionality in Themes   | Disabled in Themes. Screen saver functionality in Group Policies, Control Panel, and Sysprep continues to be functional. Lock screen features and policies are preferred. | 1709 |
|Sync your settings (updated: August 17, 2017) | Back-end changes: In future releases, the back-end storage for the current sync process will change. A single cloud storage system will be used for Enterprise State Roaming and all other users. As part of this change, we will stop supporting the Device Syncing Settings and App Data report.  All other  **Sync your settings** options and the Enterprise State Roaming feature will continue to work provided your clients are running an up-to-date version of: </br> - Windows 11 </br> - Windows 10, version 21H2, or later | 1709 |
|System Image Backup (SIB) Solution|This feature is also known as the **Backup and Restore (Windows 7)** legacy control panel. For full-disk backup solutions, look for a third-party product from another software publisher. You can also use [OneDrive](/onedrive/) to sync data files with Microsoft 365.| 1709 |
|TLS RC4 Ciphers  |To be disabled by default. For more information, see [TLS (Schannel SSP) changes in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-schannel-ssp-changes-in-windows-10-and-windows-server)| 1709 |
