# Resources for deprecated features

**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

This article provides additional resources about [deprecated features for Windows client](deprecated-features.md) that may be needed by IT professionals. The following information is provided to help IT professionals plan for the removal of deprecated features:

## Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool resources

The [Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT)](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msdt) gathers diagnostic data for analysis by support professionals. MSDT is the engine used to run legacy Windows built-in troubleshooters. There are currently 28 built-in troubleshooters for MSDT. Half of the built-in troubleshooters have already been [redirected](#redirected-msdt-troubleshooters) to the Get Help platform, while the other half will be [retired](#retired-msdt-troubleshooters).  

If you're using MSDT to run [custom troubleshooting packages](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wintt/package-schema), it will be available as a [Feature on Demand](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities) before the tool is fully retired in 2025. This change will allow you to continue to use MSDT to run custom troubleshooting packages while transitioning to a new platform. [Contact Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus) for Windows if you require additional assistance.
