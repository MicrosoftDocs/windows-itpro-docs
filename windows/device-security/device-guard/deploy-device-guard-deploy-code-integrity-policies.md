# Deploy Device Guard: deploy code integrity policies

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016

This section includes the following topics:

- [Optional: Create a code signing certificate for code integrity policies](optional-create-a-code-signing-certificate-for-code-integrity-policies.md)
- [Deploy code integrity policies: policy rules and file rules](deploy-code-integrity-policies-policy-rules-and-file-rules.md)
- [Deploy code integrity policies: steps](deploy-code-integrity-policies-steps.md)
- [Deploy catalog files to support code integrity policies](deploy-catalog-files-to-support-code-integrity-policies.md)

To increase the protection for devices that meet certain hardware requirements, you can use virtualization-based security (VBS) with your code integrity policies.
- For requirements, see [Hardware, firmware, and software requirements for Device Guard](requirements-and-deployment-planning-guidelines-for-device-guard.md#hardware-firmware-and-software-requirements-for-device-guard) in "Requirements and deployment planning guidelines for Device Guard."
- For steps, see [Deploy Device Guard: enable virtualization-based security](deploy-device-guard-enable-virtualization-based-security.md).
