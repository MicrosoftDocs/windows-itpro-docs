Cortana can automatically create a Suggested reminder, based on commitments made in email. For example, Cortana recognizes that if an employee includes the text, _I’ll get this to you by the end of the week_, he or she is making a commitment to provide something by a specific date. Cortana can now automatically create a Suggested reminder, letting the employee decide whether to keep it or to cancel it.

## Use Cortana to create Suggested reminders based on what you've promised to do in email

1. Make sure that you've connected Cortana to Office 365. For the steps to connect, see [Set up and test Cortana with Office 365 in your organization](cortana-at-work-o365.md).

2. Click on the **Cortana** search box in the taskbar, click the **Notebook** icon, and then click **Permissions**.

3. Make sure the **Contacts, email, calendar, and communication history** option is turned on.

4. Click the **Notebook** icon again, click the **Suggested reminders** option, click to turn on the **All reminder suggestions cards** option, click the **Notify me when something I mentioned doing is coming up** box, and then click **Save**.

5. Create and send an email to yourself (so you can see the Suggested reminder), including the text, _I’ll finish this project by end of day today_.

6.	After you get the email, click on the Cortana **Home** icon, and scroll to today’s events. If the reminder has a specific date or time associated with it, like end of day, Cortana notifies you at the appropriate time and puts the reminder into the Action Center.

    Also from the **Home** screen, you can view the email where you made the promise, set aside time on your calendar, officially set the reminder, or mark the reminder as completed.
