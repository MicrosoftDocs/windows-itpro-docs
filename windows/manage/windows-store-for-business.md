<td align="left"><p>Device Guard signing is a Device Guard feature that is available in the Store for Business. It gives admins a single place to sign catalog files and code integrity policies. After admins have created catalog files for unsigned apps and signed the catalog files, they can add the signers to a code integrity policy. You can merge the code integrity policy with your existing policy to include your custom signing certificate. This allows you to trust the catalog files.</p></td>
