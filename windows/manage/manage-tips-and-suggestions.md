Since its inception, Windows 10 has included a number of user experience features that provide useful tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows, we well as app suggestions from the Windows Store. These features are designed to help people get the most out of their Windows 10 experience by, for example, sharing new features, providing more details on the features they use, or sharing content available in the Windows Store. Examples of such user experiences include: 

* **Windows Spotlight on the lock screen**.  Daily updated images on the lock screen that can include additional facts and tips in “hotspots” that are revealed on hover. 

* **Start menu app suggestions**. App suggestions in Start that recommend productivity tool or utilities from the Windows Store. 

* **Additional apps on Start**.  Additional apps pre-installed on the Start screen which can enhance the user’s experience. 

* **Windows tips**.  Contextual tips that appear based on specific user actions to reveal related Windows features or help users complete a scenario.
