# Windows 10, version 1703 and Windows Server 2016 basic telemetry level events and fields


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.


 **Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 10 Mobile
- Windows Server 2016


The Basic telemetry level gathers a limited set of information that is critical for understanding the device and its configuration including: basic device information, quality-related information, app compatibility, and Windows Store. When the telemetry level is set to Basic, it also includes the Security level information.

The Basic level helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. This helps Microsoft fix operating system or app problems.

Use this article to learn about telemetry events, grouped by event area, and the fields within each event. A brief description is provided for each field. Every event generated includes common data, which collects device data.

You can learn more about Windows functional and telemetry data through these articles:

### TelClientSynthetic.ConnectivityHeartBeat_0

This event sends data about the connectivity status of the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component that uploads telemetry events.
