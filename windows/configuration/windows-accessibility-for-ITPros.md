# Accessibility information for IT professionals

Microsoft is dedicated to making its products and services accessible and usable for everyone. Windows includes accessibility features that benefit all users. These features make it easier to customize the computer and give users with different abilities options to improve their experience with Windows.

This article helps you as the IT administrator learn about built-in accessibility features. It also includes recommendations for how to support people in your organization who use these features.

Windows 11, version 22H2, includes improvements for people with disabilities: system-wide live captions, Focus sessions, voice access, and more natural voices for Narrator. For more information, see [New accessibility features coming to Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/05/10/new-accessibility-features-coming-to-windows-11/) and [How inclusion drives innovation in Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=177554).<!-- 6294246 -->

## General recommendations

- **Be aware of Ease of Access settings**. Understand how people in your organization might use these settings. Help people in your organization learn how they can customize Windows.

- **Don't block settings**. Avoid using group policy or MDM settings that override Ease of Access settings.

- **Encourage choice**. Allow people in your organization to customize their computers based on their needs. That customization might be installing an add-on for their browser, or a non-Microsoft assistive technology.

## Vision

- [Use Narrator to use devices without a screen](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1). Narrator describes Windows and apps and enables you to control devices by using a keyboard, controller, or with a range of gestures on touch-supported devices. Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2, Narrator includes more natural voices.

- [Create accessible apps](/windows/apps/develop/accessibility). You can develop accessible apps just like Mail, Groove, and Store that work well with Narrator and other leading screen readers.

- Use keyboard shortcuts. Get the most out of Windows with shortcuts for apps and desktops.

## Physical

- [Have Cortana assist you](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-cortana-953e648d-5668-e017-1341-7f26f7d0f825). Cortana can handle various tasks for you, including setting reminders, opening apps, finding facts, and sending emails and texts.

Instead of relying on a physical keyboard, use the OSK to enter data and select keys with a mouse or other pointing device. It also offers word prediction and completion.

## Cognition

- [Simplify for focus](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/make-it-easier-to-focus-on-tasks-0d259fd9-e9d0-702c-c027-007f0e78eaf2). Reducing animations and turning off background images and transparency can minimize distractions.

- [Download and use fonts that are easier to read](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=50721). **Fluent Sitka Small** and **Fluent Calibri** are fonts that address "visual crowding" by adding character and enhance word and line spacing.
