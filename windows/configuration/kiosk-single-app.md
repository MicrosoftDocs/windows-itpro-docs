# Set up a single-app kiosk on Windows 10/11


**Applies to**

- Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education
- Windows 11

A single-app kiosk uses the Assigned Access feature to run a single app above the lock screen. When the kiosk account signs in, the app is launched automatically. The person using the kiosk cannot do anything on the device outside of the kiosk app.

![Illustration of a single-app kiosk experience.](images/kiosk-fullscreen-sm.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>[User account control (UAC)](/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-overview) must be turned on to enable kiosk mode.
>
>Kiosk mode is not supported over a remote desktop connection. Your kiosk users must sign in on the physical device that is set up as a kiosk. Apps that run in kiosk mode cannot use copy and paste.

You have several options for configuring your single-app kiosk. 

- [Locally, in Settings](#local):  The **Set up a kiosk** (previously named **Set up assigned access**) option in **Settings** is a quick and easy method to set up a single device as a kiosk for a local standard user account. 

  This option supports:

  - Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education
  - Windows 11

- [PowerShell](#powershell): You can use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to set up a single-app kiosk. First, you need to [create the user account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10) on the device and install the kiosk app for that account.

  This option supports:

  - Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education
  - Windows 11

- [The kiosk wizard in Windows Configuration Designer](#wizard): Windows Configuration Designer is a tool that produces a *provisioning package*. A provisioning package includes configuration settings that can be applied to one or more devices during the first-run experience (OOBE), or after OOBE is done (runtime). Using the kiosk wizard, you can also create the kiosk user account, install the kiosk app, and configure more useful settings.

  This option supports:

  - Windows 10 Pro version 1709+, Enterprise, and Education
  - Windows 11

- [Microsoft Intune or other mobile device management (MDM) provider](#mdm): For devices managed by your organization, you can use MDM to set up a kiosk configuration.

  This option supports:

  - Windows 10 Pro version 1709+, Enterprise, and Education
  - Windows 11

> [!TIP]
> You can also configure a kiosk account and app for single-app kiosk within [XML in a provisioning package](lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps.md) by using a [kiosk profile](lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps.md#profile).  
>
> Be sure to check the [configuration recommendations](kiosk-prepare.md) before you set up your kiosk.

## Set up a kiosk in local Settings

>App type: 
> - UWP
>
>OS:
> - Windows 10 Pro, Ent, Edu
> - Windows 11
>
>Account type:
> - Local standard user

You can use **Settings** to quickly configure one or a few devices as a kiosk. 

When your kiosk is a local device that isn't managed by Active Directory or Azure Active Directory, there is a default setting that enables automatic sign-in after a restart. That means that when the device restarts, the last signed-in user will be signed in automatically. If the last signed-in user is the kiosk account, the kiosk app will be launched automatically after the device restarts.

- If you want the kiosk account to sign in automatically, and the kiosk app launched when the device restarts, then you don't need to do anything.

- If you don't want the kiosk account to sign in automatically when the device restarts, then you must change the default setting before you configure the device as a kiosk. Sign in with the account that you will assign as the kiosk account. Open the **Settings** app > **Accounts** > **Sign-in options**. Set the **Use my sign-in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart** setting to **Off**. After you change the setting, you can apply the kiosk configuration to the device.

### Windows 10 version 1809+ / Windows 11

When you set up a kiosk (also known as *assigned access*) in **Settings** for Windows client, you create the kiosk user account at the same time. To set up assigned access in PC settings:

1.  Open the **Settings** app > **Accounts**. Select **Other users** or **Family and other users**.

2.  Select **Set up a kiosk > Assigned access**, and then select **Get started**.

3.  Enter a name for the new account. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >If there are any local standard user accounts on the device already, the **Create an account** page will offer the option to **Choose an existing account**.

4.  Choose the app that will run when the kiosk account signs in. Only apps that can run above the lock screen will be available in the list of apps to choose from. For more information, see [Guidelines for choosing an app for assigned access](guidelines-for-assigned-access-app.md). If you select **Microsoft Edge** as the kiosk app, you configure the following options:

    - Whether Microsoft Edge should display your website full-screen (digital sign) or with some browser controls available (public browser)
    - Which URL should be displayed when the kiosk accounts signs in
    - When Microsoft Edge should restart after a period of inactivity (if you select to run as a public browser)

5.  Select **Close**.

To remove assigned access, select the account tile on the **Set up a kiosk** page, and then select **Remove kiosk**.


### Windows 10 version 1803 and earlier

When you set up a kiosk (also known as *assigned access*) in **Settings** for Windows 10 version 1803 and earlier, you must select an existing local standard user account. [Learn how to create a local standard user account.](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10)

![The Set up assigned access page in Settings.](images/kiosk-settings.png)

**To set up assigned access in PC settings**

1.  Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Other people**.

2.  Select **Set up assigned access**.

3.  Choose an account.

4.  Choose an app. Only apps that can run above the lock screen will be available in the list of apps to choose from. For more information, see [Guidelines for choosing an app for assigned access](guidelines-for-assigned-access-app.md).

5.  Close **Settings** – your choices are saved automatically, and will be applied the next time that user account signs in.

To remove assigned access, choose **Turn off assigned access and sign out of the selected account**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When Exchange Active Sync (EAS) password restrictions are active on the device, the autologon feature does not work. This behavior is by design. For more informations, see [How to turn on automatic logon in Windows](/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/turn-on-automatic-logon).

When you use the **Provision kiosk devices** wizard in Windows Configuration Designer, you can configure the kiosk to run either a Universal Windows app or a Windows desktop application.

[Install Windows Configuration Designer](provisioning-packages/provisioning-install-icd.md), then open Windows Configuration Designer and select **Provision kiosk devices**. After you name your project, and select **Next**, configure the following settings:

1. Enable device setup:

    :::image type="content" source="images/set-up-device-details.png" alt-text="In Windows Configuration Designer, enable device setup, enter the device name, the product key to upgrade, turn off shared use, and remove preinstalled software.":::

    If you want to enable device setup, select **Set up device**, and configure the following settings:

    - **Device name**: Required. Enter a unique 15-character name for the device. You can use variables to add unique characters to the name, such as `Contoso-%SERIAL%` and `Contoso-%RAND:5%`.
    - **Enter product key**: Optional. Select a license file to upgrade Windows client to a different edition. For more information, see [the permitted upgrades](/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-edition-upgrades).
    - **Configure devices for shared use**: This setting optimizes Windows client for shared use scenarios, and isn't necessary for a kiosk scenario. Set this value to **No**, which may be the default.
    - **Remove pre-installed software**: Optional. Select **Yes** if you want to remove preinstalled software.

2. Set up the network:

3. Enable account management:

    :::image type="content" source="images/account-management-details.png" alt-text="In Windows Configuration Designer, join Active Directory, Azure AD, or create a local admin account.":::

    If you want to enable account management, select **Account Management**, and configure the following settings:

    - **Manage organization/school accounts**: Choose how devices are enrolled. Your options:
      - **Active Directory**: Enter the credentials for a least-privileged user account to join the device to the domain.
      - **Azure Active Directory**: Before you use a Windows Configuration Designer wizard to configure bulk Azure AD enrollment, [set up Azure AD join in your organization](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-azureadjoin-setup). In your Azure AD tenant, the **maximum number of devices per user** setting determines how many times the bulk token in the wizard can be used.

        If you select this option, enter a friendly name for the bulk token you get using the wizard. Set an expiration date for the token. The maximum is 180 days from the date you get the token. Select **Get bulk token**. In **Let's get you signed in**, enter an account that has permissions to join a device to Azure AD, and then the password. Select **Accept** to give Windows Configuration Designer the necessary permissions.

        You must run Windows Configuration Designer on Windows client to configure Azure AD enrollment using any of the wizards.

      - **Local administrator**: If you select this option, enter a user name and password. If you create a local account in the provisioning package, you must change the password using the **Settings** app every 42 days.

## Set up a kiosk or digital sign using Microsoft Intune or other MDM service

>App type: 
> - UWP
>
>OS: 
> - Windows 10 Pro version 1709+, Ent, Edu
> - Windows 11
>
>Account type:
> - Local standard user
> - Azure AD

Microsoft Intune and other MDM services enable kiosk configuration through the [AssignedAccess configuration service provider (CSP)](/windows/client-management/mdm/assignedaccess-csp). Assigned Access has a `KioskModeApp` setting. In the `KioskModeApp` setting, you enter the user account name and the [AUMID](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/find-the-application-user-model-id-of-an-installed-app) for the app to run in kiosk mode.

>[!TIP]
>A ShellLauncher node has been added to the [AssignedAccess CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/assignedaccess-csp). 

To configure a kiosk in Microsoft Intune, see [Windows client and Windows Holographic for Business device settings to run as a dedicated kiosk using Intune](/intune/kiosk-settings). For other MDM services, see the documentation for your provider.



## Sign out of assigned access

To exit the assigned access (kiosk) app, press **Ctrl + Alt + Del**, and then sign in using another account. When you press **Ctrl + Alt + Del** to sign out of assigned access, the kiosk app will exit automatically. If you sign in again as the assigned access account or wait for the sign in screen timeout, the kiosk app relaunches. The assigned access user will remain signed in until an admin account opens **Task Manager** > **Users** and signs out the user account.

If you press **Ctrl + Alt + Del** and do not sign in to another account, after a set time, assigned access will resume. The default time is 30 seconds, but you can change that in the following registry key:

`HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI`

To change the default time for assigned access to resume, add *IdleTimeOut* (DWORD) and enter the value data as milliseconds in hexadecimal.

> [!NOTE]
> **IdleTimeOut** doesn't apply to the new Microsoft Edge kiosk mode.

The Breakout Sequence of **Ctrl + Alt + Del** is the default, but this sequence can be configured to be a different sequence of keys. The breakout sequence uses the format **modifiers + keys**. An example breakout sequence would look something like **Shift + Alt + a**, where **Shift** and **Alt** are the modifiers and **a** is the key value. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge kiosk XML sample](/windows/configuration/kiosk-xml#microsoft-edge-kiosk-xml-sample).
