# FirstExperience (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Use these settings to configure the out-of-box experience (OOBE) to set up HoloLens.

## Applies to

| Setting | Windows client | Surface Hub | HoloLens | IoT Core |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| All settings |   |  | X |  |

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PreferredRegion | Enter the [geographical location identifier](/windows/win32/intl/table-of-geographical-locations) for the region. |
| PreferredTimezone | Enter the timezone. [Microsoft Time Zone Index Values](/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms912391(v=winembedded.11)) |
| SkipCalibration | Initial setup of HoloLens includes a calibration step. Set to **True** to skip calibration. |
| SkipTraining | Initial setup of HoloLens includes training on how to perform the gestures to operate HoloLens. Set to **True** to skip training. |
| SkipWifi | Set to **True** to skip connecting to a Wi-Fi network.<br><br>**Note:** HoloLens [requires a Wi-Fi connection during setup to verify the account](/hololens/hololens2-start). To skip the Wi-Fi connection page during setup, your provisioning package must provide the network configuration. You can configure the network configuration [in the HoloLens wizard](/hololens/hololens-provisioning#provisioning-package-hololens-wizard) and then switch to the advanced editor to configure **FirstExperience** settings, or in advanced settings, configure a WLAN [connectivity profile](wcd-connectivityprofiles.md). |
