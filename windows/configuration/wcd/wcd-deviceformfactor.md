# DeviceFormFactor (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Use to identify the form factor of the device.

## Applies to

| Setting   | Windows client | Surface Hub | HoloLens | IoT Core |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

Specifies the device form factor running Windows 10. Generally, the device form is set by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), however you might want to change the device form based on its usage in your organization.

DeviceForm supports the following features or components:

- Cortana and Bing use the DeviceForm value to determine the accuracy of specific signals, such as location (GPS versus Wi-Fi versus reverse IP address lookup).
- Windows 10 features, such as Bluetooth and camera, may require DeviceForm to be accurately configured for full functionality.

Select the appropriate form from the dropdown menu.
