| Setting | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AccountModel  | - Only guest</br>- Domain-joined only</br>- Domain-joined and guest  | This option controls how users can sign in on the PC. Choosing domain-joined will enable any user in the domain to sign in. Specifying the guest option will add the Guest option to the sign in screen and enable anonymous guest access to the PC. </br></br>- Only guest allows anyone to use the PC as a local standard (non-admin) account.</br>- Domain-joined only allows users to sign in with an Active Directory or Azure AD account.</br>- Domain-joined and guest allows users to sign in with an Active Directory, Azure AD, or local standard account.  |
| DeletionPolicy  | - Delete immediately </br>- Delete at disk space threshold</br>- Delete at disk space threshold and inactive threshold | - **Delete immediately** deletes the account on sign out.</br>- **Delete at disk space threshold** starts deleting accounts when available disk space falls below the threshold you set for `DiskLevelDeletion`. It stops deleting accounts when the available disk space reaches the threshold you set for `DiskLevelCaching`. Accounts are deleted in order of oldest accessed to most recently accessed.</br>- **Delete at disk space threshold and inactive threshold** applies the same disk space checks as noted above. It also deletes accounts if they haven't signed in within the number of days in `InactiveThreshold`.  |
| DiskLevelCaching  | A number between 0 and 100  | If you set **DeletionPolicy** to **Delete at disk space threshold**, set the percent of total disk space to be used as the disk space threshold for account caching.  |
| DiskLevelDeletion  | A number between 0 and 100  | If you set **DeletionPolicy** to **Delete at disk space threshold**, set the percent of total disk space to be used as the disk space threshold for account deletion.  |
| EnableAccountManager  | True or false  | Set as **True** to enable automatic account management. When set to **False**, no automatic account management will be done.  |
| InactiveThreshold  | Number  | If you set **DeletionPolicy** to **Delete at disk space threshold and inactive threshold**, set the number of days after which an account that hasn't signed in will be deleted.  |
| KioskModeAUMID  | String  | Set an Application User Model ID (AUMID) to enable the kiosk account on the sign in screen. A new account will be created and will use assigned access to only run the app specified by the AUMID. The app must be installed on the PC. Set the name of the account using **KioskModeUserTileDisplayText**, or a default name will be used. [Find the Application User Model ID of an installed app](/previous-versions/windows/embedded/dn449300(v=winembedded.82))  |
| KioskModeUserTileDisplayText  | String  | Sets the display text on the kiosk account if **KioskModeAUMID** has been set.  |
