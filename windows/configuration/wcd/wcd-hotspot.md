# HotSpot (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Do not use. Enterprise admins who want to configure settings for mobile hotspots should use [Policies > Wifi](wcd-policies.md#wifi). Mobile operators should use the [Country and Operator Settings Asset (COSA) format](/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/cosa-overview).
