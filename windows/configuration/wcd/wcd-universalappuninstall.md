## RemoveProvisionedApp

Universal apps can be *provisioned*. Provisioned means that they're available on the device for installation in user context. When a user runs the provisioned app, the app is then installed for that user. 

Use **RemoveProvisionedApp** to remove app packages that are available on the device. Any instances of the app that have already been installed by a user aren't uninstalled. To uninstall provisioned apps that have been installed by a user, use the [Uninstall](#uninstall) setting.

1. Enter the PackageFamilyName for the app package, and then select **Add**.
2. Select the PackageFamilyName in the Available Customizations pane, and then select **RemoveProvisionedApp**.

## Uninstall

Use **Uninstall** to remove provisioned apps that have been installed by a user.

1. Enter the PackageFamilyName for the app package, and then select **Add**.
2. Select the PackageFamilyName in the Available Customizations pane, and then select **Uninstall**.
