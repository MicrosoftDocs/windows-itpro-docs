# Assigned Access policy settings

When the Assigned Access configuration is applied on a device, certain policy settings and AppLocker rules are enforced, impacting the users accessing the device. The policy settings use a combination of configuration service provider (CSP) and group policy (GPO) settings.

This reference article lists the policy settings and AppLocker rules applied by Assigned Access.

>[!NOTE]
>It's not recommended to configure policy settings enforced by Assigned Access to different values using other channels. Assigned Access is optimized to provide a locked-down experience.

## Device policy settings

The following policy settings are applied at the device level when you deploy a restricted user experience. Any user accessing the device is subject to the policy settings, including administrator accounts:

## AppLocker rules

When you deploy an Assigned Access restricted user experience, AppLocker rules are generated to allow the apps that are listed in the configuration. Here are the predefined Assigned Access AppLocker rules:

### Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app rules

1. The default rule is to allow all users to launch the signed *packaged apps*
1. The packaged app *deny list* is generated at runtime when the Assigned Access user signs in:
    1. Based on the installed apps available for the user account, Assigned Access generates the deny list. The list excludes the default allowed inbox packaged apps, which are critical for the system to function, and then exclude the allowed packages that are defined in the Assigned Access configuration
    1. If there are multiple apps within the same package, all the apps are excluded

The deny list is used to prevent the user from accessing the apps, which are currently available for the user but not in the allowed list

> [!NOTE]
> You can't manage AppLocker rules that are generated by the restricted user experience in MMC snap-ins. Avoid creating AppLocker rules that conflict with AppLocker rules generated by Assigned Access.
>
> Assigned access doesn't prevent the organization or users from installing UWP apps. When a new UWP app is installed during an Assigned Access session, the app isn't in the deny list. When the user signs out and signs in again, the installed app is included in the deny list. For apps deployed centrally that you want to allow, like line-of-biness apps, update the Assigned Access configuration and include the apps in the *allow app list*.

### Desktop app rules

1. The default rule is to allow all users to launch the desktop programs signed with *Microsoft Certificate* for the system to boot and function. The rule also allows the admin user group to launch all desktop programs.
1. There's a predefined inbox desktop app deny list for the Assigned Access user account, which is updated based on the *desktop app allow list* that you defined in the Assigned Access configuration
1. Enterprise-defined allowed desktop apps are added in the AppLocker allow list
