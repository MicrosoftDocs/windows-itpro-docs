# Test scenario 4 - Use Cortana to find free time on your calendar for your upcoming meetings. 

<!--Using include for Cortana in Windows deprecation -->
[!INCLUDE [Deprecation of Cortana in Windows](./includes/cortana-deprecation.md)] 

This scenario helps you find out if a time slot is free on your calendar. 

1. Select the  **Cortana**  icon in the taskbar. 

2. Click on the **Cortana** icon in the taskbar, and then click in the **Search** bar. 

3. Type **Am I free at 3 PM tomorrow?** 

Cortana will respond with your availability for that time, and nearby meetings.
