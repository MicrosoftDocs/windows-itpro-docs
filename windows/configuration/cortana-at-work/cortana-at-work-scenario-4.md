# Test scenario 4 - Use Cortana to find free time on your calendar for your upcoming meetings.

This scenario helps you find out if a time slot is free on your calendar.

1. Select the  **Cortana**  icon in the taskbar.

2. Click on the **Cortana** icon in the taskbar, and then click in the **Search** bar.

3. Type **Am I free at 3 PM tomorrow?**

Cortana will respond with your availability for that time, and nearby meetings.
