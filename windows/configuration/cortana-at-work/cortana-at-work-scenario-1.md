# Test scenario 1 – Sign into Azure AD, enable the wake word, and try a voice query

>[!NOTE]
>The wake word has been re-enabled in the latest version of Cortana in Windows. If you're on Windows 10, version 2004, be sure that you've updated to build 19041.329 or later to use the wake word with Cortana. For earlier builds, you can still click on the microphone button to use your voice with Cortana.

1. Select the **Cortana** icon in the task bar and sign in using your Azure AD account.

2. Select the &quot;…&quot; menu and select **Talking to Cortana**.

3. Toggle **Wake word** to **On** and close Cortana.

4. Say **Cortana, what can you do?**

   When you say **Cortana**, Cortana will open in listening mode to acknowledge the wake word.

   Once you finish saying your query, Cortana will open with the result.

>[!NOTE]
>If you've disabled the wake word using MDM or Group Policy, you will need to manually activate the microphone by selecting Cortana, then the mic button.
