# Test scenario 1 - Sign-in to Azure AD and use Cortana to manage the notebook

-   Windows 10, version 1703
-   Windows 10 Mobile, version 1703

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft’s Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.

This scenario turns on Azure AD and let's your employee use Cortana to manage an entry in the notebook.

## Turn on Azure AD
This process helps you to sign out of a Microsoft Account and to sign into an Azure AD account.

1.	Click on the **Cortana** icon in the taskbar, click the **Notebook**, and then click **About Me**.

2.	Click your email address.

    A dialog box appears, showing the associated account info.

3.	Click your email address again, and then click **Sign out**.

    This signs out the Microsoft account, letting you continue to add and use the Azure AD account.

4.	Click the **Search** box and then the **Notebook** icon in the left rail. This will start the sign-in request.

5.	Click **Sign-In** and follow the instructions.

6.	When you’re asked to sign in, you’ll need to choose an Azure AD account, which will look like kelliecarlson@contoso.com.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If there’s no Azure AD account listed, you’ll need to go to **Windows Settings > Accounts > Email & app accounts**, and then click **Add a work or school account** to add it.

## Use Cortana to manage the notebook content
This process helps you to manage the content Cortana shows in your Notebook.

1.	Click on the **Cortana** icon in the taskbar, click the **Notebook**, scroll down and click **Weather**.

2.	In the **Weather** settings, scroll down to the **Cities your tracking** area, and then click **Add a city**.

3.	Add *Redmond, Washington*, double-click the search result, click **Add**, and then click **Save**.
