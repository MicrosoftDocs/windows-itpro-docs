# Test scenario 3 - Set a reminder

This scenario helps you set up, review, and edit a reminder. For example, you can remind yourself to send someone a link to a document after a meeting.

1. Select the **Cortana** icon in the taskbar and type **Remind me to send a link to the deck at 3:05pm** and press **Enter**.

Cortana will create a reminder in Microsoft To Do and will remind you at the appropriate time.
