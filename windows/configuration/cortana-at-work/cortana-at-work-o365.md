### Before you begin
There are a few things to be aware of before you start using Cortana in Windows 10, versions 1909 and earlier.

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account.** Before your employees can use Cortana in your org, they must be logged in using their Azure AD account through Cortana&#39;s notebook. They must also authorize Cortana to access Microsoft 365 on their behalf.

- **Office 365 Trust Center.** Cortana in Windows 10, version 1909 and earlier, isn&#39;t a service governed by the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products). [Learn more about how Cortana in Windows 10, versions 1909 and earlier, treats your data](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468233/cortana-and-privacy-microsoft-privacy).

- Windows Information Protection (WIP). If you want to secure the calendar, email, and contact info provided to Cortana on a device, you can use WIP. For more info about WIP, see [Protect your enterprise data using Windows Information Protection (WIP)](/windows/threat-protection/windows-information-protection/protect-enterprise-data-using-wip). If you decide to use WIP, you must also have a management solution. This solution can be Microsoft Intune, Configuration Manager (version 1606 or later), or your current company-wide third-party mobile device management (MDM) solution.
