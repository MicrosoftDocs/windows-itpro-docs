# Set up and test Cortana with Office 365 in your organization
**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10, version 1703
-   Windows 10 Mobile, version 1703

Cortana in Windows 10 is already great at letting your employees quickly see what the day is going to look like, do meeting prep work like researching people in LinkedIn or getting documents ready, see where and when their meetings are going to be, get a sense of travel times to and from work, and even get updates from a calendar for upcoming trips.

But Cortana works even harder when she connects to Office 365, helping employees to be notified about unusual events, such as meetings over lunch or during a typical commute time, and about early meetings, even setting an alarm so the employee isn’t late.

We’re continuing to add more and more capabilities to Cortana so she can become even more helpful with your productivity-related tasks, such as emailing, scheduling, and other tasks that are important to help you be successful.
