# Test scenario 6 – Change your language and perform a quick search with Cortana

Cortana can help employees in regions outside the US search for quick answers like currency conversions, time zone conversions, or weather in their location.

1. Select the  **Cortana**  icon in the taskbar.

2. Select the **…** menu, then select **Settings**, **Language**, then select **Español (España)**. You'll be prompted to restart the app.

3. Once the app has restarted, type or say **Convierte 100 Euros a Dólares**.
