# Test scenario 1 – Sign in with your work or school account and use Cortana to manage the notebook

This scenario turns on Azure AD and lets your employee use Cortana to manage an entry in the notebook.

## Sign in with your work or school account

This process helps you to sign out of a Microsoft Account and to sign into an Azure AD account.

1. Click on the  **Cortana**  icon in the taskbar, then click the profile picture in the navigation to open Cortana settings.

2. Click your email address.

A dialog box appears, showing the associated account info.

3. Click **Sign out** under your email address.

This signs out the Microsoft account, letting you continue to add your work or school account.

4. Open Cortana again and select the  **Sign in** glyph in the left rail and follow the instructions to sign in with your work or school account.

## Use Cortana to manage the notebook content

This process helps you to manage the content Cortana shows in your Notebook.

1. Select the  **Cortana**  icon in the taskbar, click **Notebook**, select **Manage Skills.** Scroll down and click  **Weather**.

2. In the  **Weather**  settings, scroll down to the  **Cities you're tracking** area, and then click **Add a city**.

3. Add **Redmond, Washington**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft's Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.
