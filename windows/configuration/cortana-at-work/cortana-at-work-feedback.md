If you don't want to use the feedback tool in Cortana, you can add feedback through the general Windows Insider Program feedback app. For info about the feedback app, see [How to use Windows Insider Preview – Updates and feedback](https://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-updates-feedback-pc).
