# Configure Windows 10 Mobile devices

Windows 10 Mobile enables administrators to define what users can see and do on a device, which you might think of as "configuring" or "customizing" or "device lockdown". Your device configuration can provide a standard Start screen with pre-installed apps, or restrict various settings and features, or even limit the device to run only a single app (kiosk).
