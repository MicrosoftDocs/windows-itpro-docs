# Accessibility information for IT Professionals 
Microsoft is dedicated to making its products and services accessible and usable for everyone. Windows 10 includes accessibility features that benefit all users. These features make it easier to customize the computer and give users with different abilities options to improve their experience with Windows. 
This topic helps IT administrators learn about built-in accessibility features, and includes a few recommendations for how to support people in your organization who use these features.

## General recommendations
- **Be aware of Ease of Access settings** – Understand how people in your organization might use these settings. Help people in your organization learn how they can customize Windows 10. 
- **Do not block settings** – Avoid using Group Policy or MDM settings that override Ease of Access settings. 
- **Encourage choice** – Allow people in your organization to customize their computers based on their needs. That might mean installing an add-on for their browser, or a non-Microsoft assistive technology.
