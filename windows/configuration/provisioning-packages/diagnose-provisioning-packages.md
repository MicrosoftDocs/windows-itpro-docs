# Diagnose Provisioning Packages

This article helps diagnose common issues with applying provisioning packages. You can use the [MdmDiagnosticsTool](/windows/client-management/diagnose-mdm-failures-in-windows-10) to diagnose general provisioning failures.

## Unable to apply power settings

When you apply a provisioning package (PPKG) containing power settings, elevated permissions are required. Because elevated permissions are required, power settings applied using the user context after the [initial setup](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-apply-package#after-initial-setup) results in the error `STATUS_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD (HRESULT=0xc0000061)` because an incorrect security context was used.

To apply the power settings successfully with the [correct security context](/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account), place the PPKG in `%WINDIR%/Provisioning/Packages` directory, and reboot the device. For more information, see [Configure power settings](/windows-hardware/customize/power-settings/configure-power-settings).

## Unable to perform bulk enrollment in Microsoft Entra ID

When you [enroll devices into Microsoft Entra ID using provisioning packages](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/bulk-join-a-windows-device-to-azure-ad-and-microsoft-endpoint/ba-p/2381400), the bulk token request is rejected, if the user requesting a bulk token isn't authorized to grant application consent. For more information, see [Configure how users consent to applications](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent).

> [!NOTE]
> When obtaining the bulk token, you should select "No, sign in to this app only" when prompted for authentication. If you select "OK" instead without also selecting "Allow my organization to manage my device", the bulk token request might be rejected.

## Unable to apply a multivariant provisioning package

When you apply a [multivariant package](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-multivariant), it might be difficult to diagnose why a certain target didn't get applied. There may be improperly authored conditions that didn't evaluate as expected.

Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2, [MdmDiagnosticsTool](/windows/client-management/diagnose-mdm-failures-in-windows-10) includes multivariant condition values to diagnose problems with multivariant packages to determine why the package wasn't applied.

You can use the following PowerShell example to review the multivariant conditions in the `MDMDiagReport.xml` report:

```powershell
([XML](Get-Content MDMDiagReport.xml)).SelectNodes('//Multivariant') | Select -ExpandProperty Condition
```
