# Accessibility information for IT professionals

Microsoft is dedicated to making its products and services accessible and usable for everyone. Windows includes accessibility features that benefit all users. These features make it easier to customize the computer and give users with different abilities options to improve their experience with Windows.

For more information about the accessibility resources available in Windows, see [Discover Windows accessibility features](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/discover-windows-accessibility-features-8b1068e6-d3b8-4ba8-b027-133dd8911df9#WindowsVersion=Windows_11).

Windows 11, version 22H2, includes improvements for people with disabilities. For example, system-wide live captions, Focus sessions, voice access, and more natural voices for Narrator. For more information, see the following Windows Experience blog posts:

- [How inclusion drives innovation in Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/09/20/how-inclusion-drives-innovation-in-windows-11/)

## General recommendations

- **Be aware of Ease of Access settings**. Understand how people in your organization might use these settings. Help people in your organization learn how they can customize Windows.

- **Don't block settings**. Avoid using group policy or MDM settings that override Ease of Access settings.

- **Encourage choice**. Allow people in your organization to customize their computers based on their needs. That customization might be installing an add-on for their browser, or a non-Microsoft assistive technology.

- Use the [Azure AI Translator](/azure/ai-services/translator/) service to add machine translation to your solutions.

- [Create accessible apps](/windows/apps/develop/accessibility) that work well with Narrator and other leading screen readers.

- [Download and use fonts that are easier to read](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=50721). **Fluent Sitka Small** and **Fluent Calibri** are fonts that address "visual crowding" by adding character and enhance word and line spacing.
