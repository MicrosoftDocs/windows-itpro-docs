# Administering UE-V

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1607

After you finish deploying User Experience Virtualization (UE-V), you'll perform ongoing administrative tasks, such as managing the configuration of the UE-V service and recovering lost settings. These tasks are explained in the following sections.

## Managing UE-V configurations


In the course of the UE-V lifecycle, you'll manage the configuration of the UE-V service and also manage storage locations for resources such as settings package files.

[Manage Configurations for UE-V](uev-manage-configurations.md)

## Working with custom UE-V templates and the UE-V template generator


This topic explains how to use the UE-V template generator and manage custom settings location templates.

## Back up and restore application and Windows settings that are synchronized with UE-V


Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Windows PowerShell features of UE-V allow you to restore settings packages. By using WMI and Windows PowerShell commands, you can restore application and Windows settings to their original state and restore other settings when a user adopts a new device.

## Changing the frequency of UE-V scheduled tasks


You can configure the scheduled tasks that manage when UE-V checks for new or updated settings or for updated custom settings location templates in the settings template catalog.

## Migrating UE-V settings packages


You can relocate the user settings packages either when they migrate to a new server or for backup purposes.

## Using UE-V with Application Virtualization applications


You can use UE-V with Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) to share settings between virtual applications and installed applications across multiple computers.
