### Do not allow pinning items in Jump Lists

With this policy setting you control the pinning of items in Jump Lists.

- If you enable this policy setting, users can't pin files, folders, websites, or other items to their Jump Lists in the Start Menu and Taskbar. Users can't unpin existing items pinned to their Jump Lists. Existing items already pinned to their Jump Lists continue to show
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can pin files, folders, websites, and other items to a program's Jump List so that the items are always present in this menu
