### Show additional calendar

By default, the calendar is set according to the locale of the operating system, and users can show an additional calendar.

- For `zh-CN` and `zh-SG` locales, an additional calendar shows the lunar month and date and holiday names in Simplified Chinese (Lunar) by default
- For `zh-TW`, `zh-HK`, and `zh-MO` locales, an additional calendar shows the lunar month and date and holiday names in Traditional Chinese (Lunar) by default

- If you enable this policy setting, users can show an additional calendar in either Simplified Chinese (Lunar) or Traditional Chinese (Lunar), regardless of the locale
- If you disable this policy setting, users can't show an additional calendar, regardless of the locale
- If you don't configure this policy setting, the calendar will be set according to the default logic
