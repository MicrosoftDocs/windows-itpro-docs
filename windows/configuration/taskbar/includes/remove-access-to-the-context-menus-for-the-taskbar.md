### Remove access to the context menus for the taskbar

With this policy setting you can remove access to the context menus for the taskbar.

- If you enable this policy setting, the menus that appear when you right-click the taskbar and items on the taskbar are hidden. For example the Start button, the clock, and the taskbar buttons.
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the context menus for the taskbar are available

This policy setting doesn't prevent users from using other methods to issue the commands that appear on these menus.
