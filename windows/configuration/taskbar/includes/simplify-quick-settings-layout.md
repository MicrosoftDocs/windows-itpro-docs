### Simplify Quick Settings Layout

- If you enable this policy, Quick Settings is reduced to only having the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accessibility, and VPN buttons. The brightness slider, volume slider, and battery indicator and link to the Settings app
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the regular Quick Settings layout appears whenever Quick Settings is invoked
