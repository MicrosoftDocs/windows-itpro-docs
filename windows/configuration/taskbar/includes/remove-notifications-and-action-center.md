### Remove Notifications and Action Center

This policy setting removes *Notifications* and *Action Center* from the notification area on the taskbar.

The notification area is located at the far right end of the taskbar, and includes icons for current notifications and the system clock.

- If this setting is enabled, Notifications and Action Center aren't displayed in the notification area. The user can read notifications when they appear, but they can't review any notifications they miss
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Notification and Security and Maintenance are displayed on the taskbar
