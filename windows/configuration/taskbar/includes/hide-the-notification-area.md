### Hide the notification area

This setting affects the notification area (previously called the "system tray") on the taskbar. Description: The notification area is located at the far right end of the task bar and includes the icons for current notifications and the system clock. If this setting is enabled, the user?s entire notification area, including the notification icons, is hidden. The taskbar displays only the Start button, taskbar buttons, custom toolbars (if any), and the system clock. If this setting is disabled or isn't configured, the notification area is shown in the user's taskbar. Note: Enabling this setting overrides the "Turn off notification area cleanup" setting, because if the notification area is hidden, there's no need to clean up the icons.
