### Prevent grouping of taskbar items

Taskbar grouping consolidates similar applications when there's no room on the taskbar. It kicks in when the user's taskbar is full.

- If you enable this policy setting, it prevents the taskbar from grouping items that share the same program name. By default, this setting is always enabled
- If you disable or don't configure it, items on the taskbar that share the same program are grouped together. The users have the option to disable grouping if they choose
