### Don't use the tracking-based method when resolving shell shortcuts

This policy setting prevents the system from using NTFS tracking features to resolve a shortcut. If you enable this policy setting, the system doesn't try to locate the file by using its file ID. It skips this step and begins a comprehensive search of the drive specified in the target path. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, by default, when the system can't find the target file for a shortcut (.lnk), it searches all paths associated with the shortcut. If the target file is located on an NTFS partition, the system then uses the target's file ID to find a path. If the resulting path isn't correct, it conducts a comprehensive search of the target drive in an attempt to find the file. Note: This policy setting only applies to target files on NTFS partitions. FAT partitions don't have this ID tracking and search capability.
