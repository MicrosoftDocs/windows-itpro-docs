### Show *Run as different user* command

With this policy setting, you can hide the *Run as different user* command on the Start application bar. If you enable it, users can access the **Run as different user** command from Start. If you disable or don't configure this setting, users can't access the **Run as different user** command from Start for any applications.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting doesn't prevent users from using other methods, such as the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> right-click menu on application's jumplists in the taskbar to issue the *Run as different user* command.
