### Hide app list

If you enable this setting, the Start Menu will either collapse or remove the all apps list from the Start menu:

- **Collapse** doesn't display the app list next to the pinned tiles in Start. An **All apps** button is displayed on Start to open the all apps list. This is equivalent to setting the **Show app list in Start** in Settings to **Off**
- **Collapse and disable setting** is the same as the collapse option and disable the **Show app list in Start menu** in Settings, so users can't turn it to On
- **Remove and disable setting** removes the all apps list from Start and disable the **Show app list in Start menu** in Settings, so users can't turn it to On
- If you disable or don't configure this setting, the all apps list is visible by default, and the user can change **Show app list in Start** in Settings
