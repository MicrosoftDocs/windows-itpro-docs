### Disable search

When you enable this policy setting, the Search UI and all its entry points are disabled, such as keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures, and type-to-search in the Start menu. The Start menu's search box and Search Taskbar buttons are hidden. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can open the Search UI and its different entry points are available.
