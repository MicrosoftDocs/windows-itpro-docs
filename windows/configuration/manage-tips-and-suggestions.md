# Manage Windows 10 and Microsoft Store tips, "fun facts", and suggestions


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10


Since its inception, Windows 10 has included a number of user experience features that provide useful tips, "fun facts", and suggestions as you use Windows, as well as app suggestions from the Microsoft Store. These features are designed to help people get the most out of their Windows 10 experience by, for example, sharing new features, providing more details on the features they use, or sharing content available in the Microsoft Store. Examples of such user experiences include: 

* **Windows Spotlight on the lock screen**.  Daily updated images on the lock screen that can include additional facts and tips in “hotspots” that are revealed on hover. 

* **Start menu app suggestions**. App suggestions in Start that recommend productivity tool or utilities from the Microsoft Store. 

* **Additional apps on Start**.  Additional apps pre-installed on the Start screen which can enhance the user’s experience. 

* **Windows tips**.  Contextual tips that appear based on specific user actions to reveal related Windows features or help users complete a scenario. 

* **Microsoft account notifications**.  For users who have a connected Microsoft account, toast notifications about their account like parental control notifications or subscription expiration. 

>[!TIP]
> On all Windows desktop editions, users can directly enable and disable Windows 10 tips, "fun facts", and suggestions and Microsoft Store suggestions.  For example, users are able to select personal photos for the lock screen as opposed to the images provided by Microsoft, or turn off tips, "fun facts", or suggestions as they use Windows.   

Windows 10 provides organizations the ability to centrally manage the type of content provided by these features through Group Policy or mobile device management (MDM). The following table describes how administrators can manage suggestions and tips in Windows 10 commercial and education editions.
