# Manage connection endpoints for Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1809

**Applies to**

- Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1809

Some Windows components, app, and related services transfer data to Microsoft network endpoints. Some examples include:

- Connecting to Microsoft Office and Windows sites to download the latest app and security updates.
- Connecting to email servers to send and receive email.
- Connecting to the web for every day web browsing.
- Connecting to the cloud to store and access backups.
- Using your location to show a weather forecast.

This article lists different endpoints that are available on a clean installation of Windows 10, version 1709 and later.
Details about the different ways to control traffic to these endpoints are covered in [Manage connections from Windows operating system components to Microsoft services](manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services.md).
Where applicable, each endpoint covered in this article includes a link to specific details about how to control traffic to it.

We used the following methodology to derive these network endpoints:

1. Set up the latest version of Windows 10 on a test virtual machine using the default settings.
2. Leave the devices running idle for a week (that is, a user isn't interacting with the system/device).
3. Use globally accepted network protocol analyzer/capturing tools and log all background egress traffic.
4. Compile reports on traffic going to public IP addresses.
5. The test virtual machine was logged in using a local account and wasn't joined to a domain or Azure Active Directory.
6. All traffic was captured in our lab using an IPV4 network.  Therefore no IPV6 traffic is reported here.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft uses global load balancers that can appear in network trace-routes. For example, an endpoint for *.akadns.net might be used to load balance requests to an Azure datacenter, which can change over time.

## Certificates

Certificates are digital files, stored on client devices, used to both encrypt data and verify the identity of an individual or organization. Trusted root certificates issued by a certification authority (CA) are stored in a certificate trust list (CTL). The Automatic Root Certificates Update mechanism contacts Windows Updates to update the CTL. If a new version of the CTL is identified, the list of trusted root certificates cached on the local device will be updated. Untrusted certificates are certificates where the server certificate issuer is unknown or isn't trusted by the service. Untrusted certificates are also stored in a list on the local device and updated by the Automatic Root Certificates Update mechanism.

If automatic updates are turned off, applications and websites may stop working because they didn't receive an updated root certificate that the application uses. Additionally, the list of untrusted certificates will no longer be updated, which increases the attack vector on the device.

The following endpoint is used by the Automatic Root Certificates Update component to automatically check the list of trusted authorities on Windows Update to see if an update is available. It's possible to [turn off traffic to this endpoint](manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services.md#automatic-root-certificates-update), but that isn't recommended because when root certificates are updated over time, applications and websites may stop working because they didn't receive an updated root certificate the application uses.

Additionally, it's used to download certificates that are publicly known to be fraudulent.
These settings are critical for both Windows security and the overall security of the Internet.
We don't recommend blocking this endpoint.
If traffic to this endpoint is turned off, Windows no longer automatically downloads certificates known to be fraudulent, which increases the attack vector on the device.

## Microsoft forward link redirection service (FWLink)

The following endpoint is used by the Microsoft forward link redirection service (FWLink) to redirect permanent web links to their actual, sometimes transitory, URL. FWlinks are similar to URL shorteners, just longer.

If you disable this endpoint, Windows Defender won't be able to update its malware definitions; links from Windows and other Microsoft products to the Web won't work; and PowerShell updateable Help won't update. To disable the traffic, instead disable the traffic that's getting forwarded.
