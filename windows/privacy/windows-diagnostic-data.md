Microsoft uses Windows diagnostic data to keep Windows secure and up-to-date, troubleshoot problems, and make product improvements. For users who have turned on "Tailored experiences", it can also be used to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft products and services for your needs. This article describes all types of optional diagnostic data collected by Windows, with comprehensive examples of data we collect per each type. For additional, detailed technical descriptions of Basic data items, see [Windows 11 required diagnostic events and fields](/windows/privacy/required-windows-11-diagnostic-events-and-fields).

In addition, this article provides references to equivalent definitions for the data types and examples from [ISO/IEC 19944-1:2020 Information technology - Cloud computing - Cloud services and devices: Data flow, data categories, and data use](https://www.iso.org/standard/79573.html). Each data type also has a Data Use statement, for diagnostics and for Tailored experiences on the device, using the terms as defined by the standard. These Data Use statements define the purposes for which Microsoft processes each type of Windows diagnostic data, using a uniform set of definitions referenced at the end of this document and based on the ISO standard. Reference to the ISO standard provides additional clarity about the information collected, and allows easy comparison with other services or guidance that also references the standard.

The data covered in this article is grouped into the following types:

- Common data extensions (diagnostic header information)
- Device, Connectivity, and Configuration data
- Product and Service Usage data
- Product and Service Performance data
- Software Setup and Inventory data
- Browsing History data
- Inking, Typing, and Speech Utterance data
