# Windows 10, version 1809 basic level Windows diagnostic events and fields

 **Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 1809

The Basic level gathers a limited set of information that is critical for understanding the device and its configuration including: basic device information, quality-related information, app compatibility, and Microsoft Store. When the level is set to Basic, it also includes the Security level information.

The Basic level helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. This helps Microsoft fix operating system or app problems.

Use this article to learn about diagnostic events, grouped by event area, and the fields within each event. A brief description is provided for each field. Every event generated includes common data, which collects device data.

## Hang Reporting events

### Microsoft.Windows.HangReporting.AppHangEvent

This event sends data about hangs for both native and managed applications, to help keep Windows up to date. It does not contain any Watson bucketing information.
