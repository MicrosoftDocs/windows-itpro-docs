# Windows 10, version 1903, connection endpoints for non-Enterprise editions

 **Applies to**

- Windows 10 Home, version 1903
- Windows 10 Professional, version 1903
- Windows 10 Education, version 1903

In addition to the endpoints listed for [Windows 10 Enterprise](manage-windows-1903-endpoints.md), the following endpoints are available on other non-Enterprise editions of Windows 10, version 1903.

The following methodology was used to derive the network endpoints:

1. Set up the latest version of Windows 10 on a test virtual machine using the default settings.
2. Leave the device(s) running idle for a week ("idle" means a user is not interacting with the system/device).
3. Use globally accepted network protocol analyzer/capturing tools and log all background egress traffic.
4. Compile reports on traffic going to public IP addresses.
5. The test virtual machine(s) was logged into using a local account, and was not joined to a domain or Azure Active Directory.
6. All traffic was captured in our lab using an IPV4 network. Therefore, no IPV6 traffic is reported here.
7. These tests were conducted in an approved Microsoft lab. It's possible your results may be different.
8. These tests were conducted for one week, but if you capture traffic for longer you may have different results.


> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft uses global load balancers that can appear in network trace-routes. For example, an endpoint for *.akadns.net might be used to load balance requests to an Azure datacenter, which can change over time.
