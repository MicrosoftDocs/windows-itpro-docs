10. **General.** 

    1. **Non-Exclusivity.** These Terms are nonexclusive. These Terms do not restrict either party from entering into the same or similar arrangement with any third party.

    2. **Jurisdiction and Governing Law.** The laws of the State of Washington, excluding conflicts of law provisions, govern these Terms. If federal jurisdiction exists, then each party consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts in King County, Washington. If no federal jurisdiction exists, then each party consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington.

    3. **Force Majeure.** A party will not be liable for failure to perform an obligation under these Terms to the extent that failure is due to a cause beyond that party’s reasonable control, including natural disaster, war, civil disturbance, or governmental action.

  <b>Attachment 1: GDPR Terms</b><br>

For purposes of these GDPR Terms, you and Microsoft agree that you are the controller of Personal Data and Microsoft is the processor of such data, except when you act as a processor of Personal Data, in which case Microsoft is a subprocessor. These GDPR Terms apply to the processing of Personal Data, within the scope of the GDPR, by Microsoft on your behalf. These GDPR Terms do not limit or reduce any data protection commitments Microsoft makes to you in other agreement between Microsoft and you. These GDPR Terms do not apply where Microsoft is a controller of Personal Data. 

**Relevant GDPR Obligations: Articles 28, 32, and 33**

1. Microsoft shall not engage another processor without prior specific or your general written authorization. In the case of general written authorization, Microsoft shall inform you of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving you the opportunity to object to such changes. (Article 28(2)) 
2. Processing by Microsoft shall be governed by these GDPR Terms under European Union (hereafter “Union”) or Member State law and are binding on Microsoft with regard to you. The subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal Data, the categories of data subjects and your obligations and rights are set forth in the Terms above, including these GDPR Terms. In particular, Microsoft shall:

    1. process the Personal Data only on your documented instructions, including with  regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which Microsoft is subject; in such a case, Microsoft shall inform you of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;

    2. ensure that persons authorized to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;

    3. take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR;

    4. respect the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 for engaging another processor;

    5. taking into account the nature of the processing, assist you by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of your obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR;

    6. assist you in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to Microsoft;

    7. at your choice, delete or return all the Personal Data to you after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data;

    8. make available to you all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by you or another auditor mandated by you.

    9. immediately inform you if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes the GDPR or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.  (Article 28(3)) 

3. Where Microsoft engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on your behalf, the same data protection obligations as set out in these GDPR Terms shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, Microsoft shall remain fully liable to you for the performance of that other processor's obligations. (Article 28(4)) 

4. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, you and Microsoft shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:

    1. the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;

    2. the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;

    3. the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and

    4. a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. (Article 32(1))

5. In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. (Article 32(2)) 

6. You and Microsoft shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under your authority or Microsoft’s who has access to Personal Data does not process them except on instructions from you, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. (Article 32(4)) 

7. Microsoft shall notify you without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. (Article 33(2)). Such notification will include that information a processor must provide to a controller under Article 33(3) to the extent such information is reasonably available to Microsoft. 

<p align="center">
  <b>Attachment 2 – The Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors)</b><br>

In countries where regulatory approval is required for use of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses cannot be relied upon under European Commission 2010/87/EU (of February 2010) to legitimize export of data from the country, unless Customer has the required regulatory approval.
Beginning May 25, 2018 and thereafter, references to various Articles from the Directive 95/46/EC in the Standard Contractual Clauses below will be treated as references to the relevant and appropriate Articles in the GDPR.
For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, Customer (as data exporter) and Microsoft Corporation (as data importer, whose signature appears below), each a “party,” together “the parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.

**Clause 1: Definitions**

1. 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; 
1. 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data; 
1. 'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC; 
1. 'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract; 
1. 'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established; 
1. 'technical and organizational security measures' means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. 

**Clause 2: Details of the transfer**

The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 below which forms an integral part of the Clauses.

**Clause 3: Third-party beneficiary clause**

1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(2) to (9), Clause 5(1) to (5), and (7) to (10), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary. 
2.1.exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. 
1. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(1) to (5) and (7), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 
1. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. 

**Clause 4: Obligations of the data exporter**

The data exporter agrees and warrants:

1. that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State; 
1. that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; 
1. that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 below; 
1. that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation; 
1. that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; 
1. that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC; 
1. to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(2) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; 
1. to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; 
1. that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and 
1. that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(1) to (9).

**Clause 5: Obligations of the data importer**

The data importer agrees and warrants: 

1. to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; 
1. that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; 
1. that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred; 
1. that it will promptly notify the data exporter about: 
    1. any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, 
    1. any accidental or unauthorised access, and 
    1. any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;

1. at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority; 
1. to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter; 
1. that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent; 
1. that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; and
1. to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.

**Clause 6: Liability**

1. The parties agree that any data subject who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. 
1. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. 
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. 
1. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 

**Clause 7: Mediation and jurisdiction**

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: 
    1. to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority; 
    1. to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. 
1. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. 

**Clause 8: Cooperation with supervisory authorities**

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. 
1. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law. 
1. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (2). 

**Clause 9: Governing Law**

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. 

**Clause 10: Variation of the contract**

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause. 

**Clause 11: Subprocessing**

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement. 
1. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 
1. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established. 
1. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority. 

**Clause 12: Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services**

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. 
1. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
