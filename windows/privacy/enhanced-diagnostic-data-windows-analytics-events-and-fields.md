# Windows 10 diagnostic data events and fields collected through the limit enhanced diagnostic data policy

 **Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 1709 and newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Upgrade Readiness and Device Health solutions of Windows Analytics are being retired on January 31, 2020. [Update Compliance](/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-get-started) will continue to be supported.
> For more information, see [Windows Analytics retirement on January 31, 2020](/lifecycle/announcements/windows-analytics-retirement).

Desktop Analytics reports are powered by diagnostic data not included in the Basic level.

In Windows 10, version 1709, we introduced a new feature: "Limit Enhanced diagnostic data to the minimum required by Windows Analytics". When enabled, this feature limits the operating system diagnostic data events included in the Enhanced level to only the events described below. The Enhanced level also includes limited crash reports, which are not described below. For more information on the Enhanced level, see [Configure Windows diagnostic data in your organization](configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization.md).

With the retirement of Windows Analytics, this policy will continue to be supported by Desktop Analytics, but will not include Office related diagnostic data.
