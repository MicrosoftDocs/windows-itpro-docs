## Acrolinx Scorecards
 
**The minimum Acrolinx topic score of 80 is required for all MAGIC content merged to the default branch.**

If you need a scoring exception for content in this PR, add the *Sign off* and the *Acrolinx exception* labels to the PR. The PubOps Team will review the exception request and may take one or more of the following actions:

- Work with you to resolve the issues requiring the exception.
- Escalate the exception request to the Acrolinx Review Team for review.
- Approve the exception and work with the GitHub Admin Team to merge the PR to the default branch.

For more information about the exception criteria and exception process, see [Minimum Acrolinx topic scores for publishing](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office-authoring-guide/acrolinx-min-score?branch=master).
