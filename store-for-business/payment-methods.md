# Payment methods

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).

You can purchase products and services from Microsoft Store for Business using your credit card. You can enter your credit card information on **Payment methods**, or when you purchase an app. We currently accept these credit cards:
- VISA
- MasterCard
- Discover
- American Express
- Japan Commercial Bureau (JCB)

> [!NOTE]
> Not all cards available in all countries. When you add a payment option, Microsoft Store for Business shows which cards are available in your region.

## Add a payment method

Once you select **Add**, the information you provided will be validated with a test authorization transaction and, if validated, the payment option will be added to your list of available payment options. Otherwise, you will be prompted for additional information or notified if there are any issues.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding credit or debit cards, you may be prompted to enter a CVV. The CVV is only used for verification purposes and is not stored in our systems after validation.

## Edit payment method
**To update a payment option**

2. Click **Manage**, click **Billing & payments**, and then click **Payments methods**.

Otherwise, you will be prompted for additional information or notified if there are any problems.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain actions, like updating or adding a payment option, require temporary "test authorization" transactions to validate the payment option. These may appear on your statement as $0.00 authorizations or as small pending transactions. These transactions are temporary and should not impact your account unless you make several changes in a short period of time, or have a low balance.
