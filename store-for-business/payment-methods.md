# Payment methods

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).
> - In April 2023 the Microsoft Store for Business tab was removed from Microsoft Store apps on Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. An interaction with existing MDM and GPO policies may lead to customers seeing errors when accessing the Microsoft Store app. For more information see [Microsoft Store for Business tab removed](manage-access-to-private-store.md#microsoft-store-for-business-tab-removed).

- Japan Commercial Bureau (JCB)

> [!NOTE]
> Not all cards available in all countries/regions. When you add a payment option, Microsoft Store for Business shows which cards are available in your region.

Otherwise, you will be prompted for additional information or notified if there are any issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain actions, like updating or adding a payment option, require temporary "test authorization" transactions to validate the payment option. These may appear on your statement as $0.00 authorizations or as small pending transactions. These transactions are temporary and should not impact your account unless you make several changes in a short period of time, or have a low balance.
