# Payment methods
You can purchase products and services from Microsoft Store for Business using your credit card. You can enter your credit card information on **Payment methods**, or when you purchase an app. We currently accept these credit cards:
- VISA
- MasterCard
- Discover
- American Express
- Japan Commercial Bureau (JCB)

> [!NOTE]
> Not all cards available in all countries. When you add a payment option, Microsoft Store for Business shows which cards are available in your region.

## Add a payment method
**To add a new payment option**

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com) or [Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).
2. Select **Manage**, select **Billing & payments**, and then select **Payments methods**.
3. Select **Add a payment options**, and then select the type of credit card that you want to add.
4. Add information to required fields, and then select **Add**.

Once you select **Add**, the information you provided will be validated with a test authorization transaction and, if validated, the payment option will be added to your list of available payment options. Otherwise, you will be prompted for additional information or notified if there are any issues.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding credit or debit cards, you may be prompted to enter a CVV. The CVV is only used for verification purposes and is not stored in our systems after validation.

## Edit payment method
**To update a payment option**

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com) or [Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Manage**, click **Billing & payments**, and then click **Payments methods**.
3. Select the payment option that you want to update, select the ellipses, and then choose **Edit payment method**.
4. Enter any updated information in the appropriate fields, and then se;ect**Save**.

Once you click **Update**, the information you provided will be validated with a test authorization transaction and, if validated, the payment option will be added to your list of available payment options. Otherwise, you will be prompted for additional information or notified if there are any problems.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain actions, like updating or adding a payment option, require temporary “test authorization” transactions to validate the payment option. These may appear on your statement as $0.00 authorizations or as small pending transactions. These transactions are temporary and should not impact your account unless you make several changes in a short period of time, or have a low balance.
