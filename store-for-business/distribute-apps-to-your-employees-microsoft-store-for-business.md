# Distribute apps to your employees from Microsoft Store for Business and Education

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).
> - In April 2023 the Microsoft Store for Business tab was removed from Microsoft Store apps on Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. An interaction with existing MDM and GPO policies may lead to customers seeing errors when accessing the Microsoft Store app. For more information see [Microsoft Store for Business tab removed](manage-access-to-private-store.md#microsoft-store-for-business-tab-removed).

Distribute apps to your employees from Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education. You can assign apps to employees, or let employees install them from your private store.

| [Distribute apps using your private store](distribute-apps-from-your-private-store.md) | The private store is a feature in Microsoft Store that organizations and schools receive during the signup process. When admins add apps to the private store, all people in the organization can view and download the apps. Only apps with online licenses can be added to the private store. |
| [Assign apps to employees](assign-apps-to-employees.md) | Admins can assign online-licensed apps to people in their organization. |
| [Distribute apps with a management tool](distribute-apps-with-management-tool.md) |  Admins can configure a mobile device management (MDM) tool to synchronize your Microsoft Store inventory. Microsoft Store management tool services work with MDM tools to manage content. | 
| [Distribute offline apps](distribute-offline-apps.md) | Offline licensing is a new licensing option for Windows 10. With offline licenses, organizations can download apps and their licenses to deploy within their network, or on devices that are not connected to the Internet. This allows organizations to deploy apps to devices without connectivity to the Store. |
