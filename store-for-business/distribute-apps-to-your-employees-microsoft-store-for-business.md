| [Distribute apps using your private store](distribute-apps-from-your-private-store.md) | The private store is a feature in Microsoft Store that organizations and schools receive during the signup process. When admins add apps to the private store, all people in the organization can view and download the apps. Only apps with online licenses can be added to the private store. |
| [Assign apps to employees](assign-apps-to-employees.md) | Admins can assign online-licensed apps to people in their organization. |
| [Distribute apps with a management tool](distribute-apps-with-management-tool.md) |  Admins can configure a mobile device management (MDM) tool to synchronize your Microsoft Store inventory. Microsoft Store management tool services work with MDM tools to manage content. | 
| [Distribute offline apps](distribute-offline-apps.md) | Offline licensing is a new licensing option for Windows 10. With offline licenses, organizations can download apps and their licenses to deploy within their network, or on devices that are not connected to the Internet. This allows organizations to deploy apps to devices without connectivity to the Store. |
