# What's new in Microsoft Store for Business and Education

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).

## Latest updates for Store for Business and Education

**May 2023**

**Removal of Microsoft Store for Business tab from Microsoft Store app on Windows 10 PCs**

The Microsoft Store for Business tab was removed from the Microsoft Store app on Windows 10. The Microsoft Store for Business tab is still available on HoloLens devices.

Users on Windows 10 PCs can no longer do the following tasks:

- see Line of Business (LOB) products listed in the Microsoft Store for Business tab
- acquire or install [online apps](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/manage-apps-from-the-windows-store-for-business#online-and-offline-apps)
- assign licenses for existing [online apps](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/manage-apps-from-the-windows-store-for-business#online-and-offline-apps) using the Store for Business portal or Store for Business app

[Offline app](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/manage-apps-from-the-windows-store-for-business#online-and-offline-apps) distribution and licensing scenarios aren't impacted by this change.

We recommend that you add your apps through the new Microsoft Store app experience in Intune. If an app isn’t available in the Microsoft Store, you must retrieve an app package from the vendor and install it as an LOB app or Win32 app. For instructions, read the following articles:

- [Add Microsoft Store apps to Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/store-apps-microsoft)
- [Add a Windows line-of-business app to Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/lob-apps-windows)
- [Add, assign, and monitor a Win32 app in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-add)

Follow the [Intune Customer Success blog](https://aka.ms/IntuneCustomerSuccess) where we will publish more information about this change.
