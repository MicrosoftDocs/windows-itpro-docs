For more information about this change, see [Update to Endpoint Manager integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).

Microsoft Store for Business and Education PowerShell module (preview) is now available on [PowerShell Gallery](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853459).

> This is a preview and not intended for production environments. For production environments, continue to use **Microsoft Store for Business and Education** or your MDM tool to manage licenses. The sample scripts are not supported under any Microsoft standard support program or service. The sample scripts are provided AS IS without warranty of any kind. Microsoft further disclaims all implied warranties including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose.

You can use the PowerShell module to:

- Manage licenses - assigning and removing
- Perform bulk operations with .csv files - automates license management for customers with larger numbers of licenses

>[!NOTE]
>Assigning apps to groups is not supported via this module. Instead, we recommend leveraging the Azure Active Directory Or MSOnline Modules to save members of a group to a CSV file and follow instructions below on how to use CSV file to manage assignments.

## View items in Products and Services
Service management should encounter no breaking changes as a result of the separation of Azure Service Management and **Microsoft Store for Business and Education PowerShell** preview.

```

>[!TIP]

>2. Click **Manage** and then choose **Apps & software**.

> Microsoft Store for Business and Education identifies Minecraft: Education Edition license types using a combination of Product ID and SKU ID.

The following table lists the Product and SKU IDs.

## Assign or reclaim products
Once you have enumerated items in **Products and Service**, you can assign or reclaim licenses to and from people in your org.

These commands assign a product to a user and then reclaim it.

```powershell

Add-MSStoreSeatAssignment -ProductId 9NBLGGH4R2R6 -SkuId 0016 -Username 'user@myorganization.onmicrosoft.com'

Remove-MSStoreSeatAssignment -ProductId 9NBLGGH4R2R6 -SkuId 0016 -Username 'user@myorganization.onmicrosoft.com'
```

## Assign or reclaim a product with a .csv file
You can also use the PowerShell module to perform bulk operations on items in **Product and Services**. You'll need a .CSV file with at least one column for "Principal Names" (for example, user@host.com). You can create such a CSV using the AzureAD PowerShell Module.

**To assign or reclaim seats in bulk:**

```powershell
