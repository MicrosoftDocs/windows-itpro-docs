# Manage private store settings

**Applies to**

-   WindowsÂ 10

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education will be retired in the first quarter of 2023. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Endpoint Manager integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).

The private store is a feature in Microsoft Store for Business and Education that organizations receive during the sign up process. When admins add apps to the private store, all people in the organization can view and download the apps. Only online-licensed apps can be distributed from your private store.

The name of your private store is shown on a tab in Microsoft Store app, or on [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com), or [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).

## Private store collections
You can create collections of apps within your private store. Collections allow you to group or categorize apps - you might want a group of apps for different job functions in your company, or classes in your school.

**To add a Collection to your private store**

You can add a collection to your private store from the private store, or from the details page for an app.

**From private store**

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com) or [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).

5. Add at least one product to your collection, and then click **Done**. You can search for apps and refine results based on the source of the app, or the supported devices.

## Private store performance
We've recently made performance improvements for changes in the private store. This table includes common actions, and the current estimate for amount of time required for the change.
