# Distribute apps using your private store


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

The private store is a feature in Microsoft Store for Business and Education that organizations receive during the signup process. When admins add apps to the private store, all employees in the organization can view and download the apps. Your private store is available as a tab in Micrsoft Store app, and is usually named for your company or organization. Only apps with online licenses can be added to the private store.

You can make an app available in your private store when you acquire the app, or you can do it later from your inventory. Once the app is in your private store, employees can claim and install the app.

**To acquire an app and make it available in your private store**

1.  Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com) or [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).

2.  Click an app, choose the license type, and then click **Get the app** to acquire the app for your organization.
