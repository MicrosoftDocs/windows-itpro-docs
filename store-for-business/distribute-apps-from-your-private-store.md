# Distribute apps using your private store

**Applies to**

-   WindowsÂ 10

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education will be retired in the first quarter of 2023. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Endpoint Manager integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).

The private store is a feature in Microsoft Store for Business and Education that organizations receive during the signup process. When admins add apps to the private store, all employees in the organization can view and download the apps. Your private store is available as a tab in Microsoft Store app, and is usually named for your company or organization. Only apps with online licenses can be added to the private store.

You can make an app available in your private store when you acquire the app, or you can do it later from your inventory. Once the app is in your private store, employees can claim and install the app.

**To acquire an app and make it available in your private store**

1.  Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com) or [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com).

2.  Click an app, choose the license type, and then click **Get the app** to acquire the app for your organization.

>[!Note]
 > If you are working with a new Line-of-Business (LOB) app, you have to wait for the app to be available in **Products & services** before adding it to your private store. For more information, see [Working with line-of-business apps](working-with-line-of-business-apps.md). 

## Private store availability
You can use security groups to scope which users can install an app from your private store. For more information, see [Private store availability](app-inventory-management-microsoft-store-for-business.md#private-store-availability).

Employees can claim apps that admins added to the private store by doing the following.

**To claim an app from the private store**

1. Sign in to your computer with your Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials, and start Microsoft Store app.
2. Click the **private store** tab.
3. Click the app you want to install, and then click **Install**.
