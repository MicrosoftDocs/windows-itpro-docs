# Microsoft Application Virtualization Security Guide


This documentation introduces you to important information about deployment decisions that can affect the security of your system. It also provides you with the necessary steps to configure the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) security settings to enhance the security of your environment based on the recommendations presented in the Security Best Practices Whitepaper. If the security settings are specific to Windows but not to App-V, the documentation includes the appropriate links to that information.
