# How to Modify the Location of the Log Directory


The log directory location is where the Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer writes information about the sequencing of an application.

Use the following procedure to change the location of the directory where the App-V Sequencer will save associated logs.

**To modify the log directory location**

1.  To open the App-V Sequencer Console, on the computer running the App-V Sequencer, select **Start** / **Programs** / **Microsoft Application Virtualization** / **Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer**.

2.  To access the App-V Sequencer **Options** dialog box, select **Tools** / **Options**. On the **General** tab, specify the new directory location where you want the App-V Sequencer log file information to be saved. Alternatively, you can click **Browse** and use the **Browse For Folder** dialog box to specify a new location.

3.  To save the new location and close the **Options** dialog box, click **OK**.
