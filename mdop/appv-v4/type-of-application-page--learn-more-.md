# Type of Application Page (Learn More)


Use the **Type of Application** page to specify the type of application you are sequencing. It is important to understand and select the correct type of application you are sequencing so you can ensure you take the correct steps toward successful package creation.

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="standard-application--default-"></a>**Standard Application (default)**  
Select this option to create a package that contains an application or a suite of applications. You should select this option for most applications you plan to sequence.

<a href="" id="add-on-or-plug-in"></a>**Add-on or Plug-in**  
Select this option to create a package that extends the functionality of a standard application; for example, a plug-in for Microsoft Excel.

<a href="" id="middleware"></a>**Middleware**  
Select this option to create a package that is required by a standard application, for example, the Microsoft .NET Framework.
