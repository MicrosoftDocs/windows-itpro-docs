# Verify Applications Page (Package Accelerators)


Use the **Verify Applications** page to review the installer file dependencies that are saved with the package. These files are required when the Package Accelerator is used to create a new virtual application package.

You can add or edit the following types of information. Only the application **Name** is required; however, you should provide as much information as possible to help ensure that a new virtual application package is created successfully when you use a package accelerator:

-   **Name**. You must specify a name.

-   **Publisher**. Optionally specify information about the application publisher.

-   **Version**. Optionally specify application version information.

-   **Language**. Optionally specify language information.

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="add"></a>**Add**  
Adds a new installation file dependency that will be required when the Package Accelerator is applied.

<a href="" id="delete"></a>**Delete**  
Deletes a selected dependency file that is currently part of the Package Accelerator.

<a href="" id="edit"></a>**Edit**  
Enables you to edit the properties associated with the selected installer file’s dependency.
