# How to Remove an Application from a License Group


You can use the following procedure to remove an application from its assigned license group in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console. After you do this, you cannot apply license controls or use reports to track the license usage for this application.

**To remove an application from a license group**

1.  In the left pane of the management console, click and expand the **Applications** node.

2.  Right-click the desired application, and choose **Properties**.

3.  On the **General** tab, use the **Application License Group** pull-down menu to choose **&lt;none&gt;**.

4.  Click **OK**.

    **Note**  
      You can alter the **Properties** tab of one application at a time.
