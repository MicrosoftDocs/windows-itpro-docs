# Server Management Console: Application Virtualization System Node


The Application Virtualization System node is the top-level node in the **Scope** pane. This node displays the name of the server the console is currently controlling, or it displays the name of the local computer (if you are connected by the name) or "local" when the console is connected to the local computer. From the Application Virtualization System node, you can connect to another computer or you can connect to the current computer with a different set of credentials.

You can right-click the Application Virtualization System node to display the following elements.
