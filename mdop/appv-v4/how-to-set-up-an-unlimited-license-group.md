# How to Set Up an Unlimited License Group


You can use the following procedure in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console to set up an unlimited license group. When you set up an unlimited license group, you let an unlimited number of users access an application simultaneously.

**To set up an unlimited license group**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, right-click the **Application Licenses** node.

2.  Select **New Unlimited License**.

3.  Enter the name of the new group in the **Application License Group Name** field.

4.  Enter a value (in minutes) in the **License Expiration Warning** field.

5.  Click **Next**.

6.  Enter descriptive text in the **License Description** field.

7.  Select the **Enabled** check box to enable the license.

8.  Select the **Expiration Date** check box (if you want to set an expiration date), and enter the expiration date or use the calendar utility to select a date.

9.  If you need to associate a key with the license, enter the license key information in the **License Key** field.

10. Click **Finish**.
