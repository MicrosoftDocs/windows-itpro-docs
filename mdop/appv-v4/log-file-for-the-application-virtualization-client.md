# Log File for the Application Virtualization Client


The log file for the Application Virtualization (App-V) Client captures detailed information about operations and error conditions. You can use it when you are verifying functionality and when you are troubleshooting issues.

When the App-V Client is first installed, the log file is created by default in the location shown in the following table. The location of the log file is new for Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.5, although the location will not be changed if the client is upgraded from an earlier version.
