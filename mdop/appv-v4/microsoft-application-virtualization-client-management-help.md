# Microsoft Application Virtualization Client Management Help


The Microsoft Application Virtualization Desktop Client and the Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) provide the interface you can use to manage virtual applications on your computer. Through the user interface, you can manage applications and file type associations, and you can refresh applications from the Application Virtualization Management Servers (also referred to as application publishing servers).

This help documentation supports the Application Virtualization Desktop Client and Client for Remote Desktop Services. It includes conceptual information, step-by-step procedures, and a user interface reference.
