# How to Associate an Application with a License Group


You can enforce licensing restrictions on an application by associating the application with a license group in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console. Depending on the type of license group, you control who has access to the application and how many users can access an application at a time. You can also access license compliance reports for the application.

**Important**  
One or more application license groups must exist for you to associate an application with a license group.

 

**To associate an application with a license group**

1.  In the left pane of the management console, expand the **Applications** node.

2.  Right-click the application you want to add to a license group, and choose **Properties**.

3.  On the **General** tab, use the **Application License Group** pull-down menu to choose the group.

4.  Click **OK**.

    **Note**  
       You can alter the **Properties** tab of one application at a time.
