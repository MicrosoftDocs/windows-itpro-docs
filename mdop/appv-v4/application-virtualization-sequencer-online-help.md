# Application Virtualization Sequencer Online Help


The Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer monitors and records the installation and setup processes for software applications. Use the Sequencer to create a sequenced application that runs inside a virtual environment. The Sequencer packages the sequenced application and creates a virtual application that can be distributed to target computers and that runs in a self-contained, virtual environment. The virtual environment contains the information necessary to run the virtual application on the target computer without interacting with the operating system installed on the target computer.

For more information about the App-V Sequencer, see the following topics:
