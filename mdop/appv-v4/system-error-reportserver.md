# System Error Report


Generate the System Error Report to track the number of errors and warnings logged over time during the specified reporting period for the specified server, for the specified server group.

This report generates a bar graph that displays the fatal errors, errors, and log warnings in ascending order based on the time the messages were logged.

When you create a report, you specify the parameters that are used for collecting the data when the report is run.

Reports are not run automatically; you must run them explicitly to generate output data. The length of time it takes to run this report is determined by the amount of data collected in the data store.

After you run a report and the output is displayed in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can export the report into the following formats:

-   Adobe Acrobat (PDF)

-   Microsoft Office Excel
