# How to Edit an OSD File


Use the following procedures to modify a sequenced application package's Open Software Descriptor (OSD) file by adding or deleting an element or an attribute.

**Note**  
  Some elements do not have an attribute, so it is not possible to add an attribute to every element.

 

**Important**  
If you use the OSD editor to change the .sft file name, the HREF attribute of the CODEBASE element in the OSD file, you must use the **Save As** command to save the change to the project files.

 

**To add an element**

1.  Click the **OSD File** tab.

2.  In the navigation pane, select the sequenced application package's OSD file you want to modify.

3.  In the navigation pane, right-click the element that you want to modify. On the menu, select **Element** and select **Add**.

4.  From the menu, select the element you want to add—for example, **Codebase**.

5.  From the **File** menu, select **Save**.

**To delete an element**

1.  Click the **OSD File** tab.

2.  In the navigation pane, select the sequenced application package's OSD file you want to modify.

3.  In the navigation pane, right-click the element that you want to delete. On the menu, select **Element** and select **Delete**.

4.  From the **File** menu, select **Save**.

**To add an attribute**

1.  Click the **OSD File** tab.

2.  In the navigation pane, select the sequenced application package's OSD file you want to modify.

3.  In the left pane, right-click the element to which you want to add an attribute. On the menu, select **Attribute** and select **Add**, choosing from the listed available attributes.

4.  From the **File** menu, select **Save**.

**To delete an attribute**

1.  Click the **OSD File** tab.

2.  In the navigation pane, select the sequenced application package's OSD file you want to modify.

3.  In the navigation pane, right-click the element from which you want to delete an attribute. On the menu, select **Attribute** and then select **Delete**, choosing the attribute you wish to delete.

4.  From the **File** menu, select **Save**.
