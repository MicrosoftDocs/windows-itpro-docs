# Side-by-side Privatization Failed Dialog Box (App-V 4.6 SP1)


The Side-by-side assembly privatization failed. You can find more information about the side-by-side assemblies in the Sequencer log file which is located in the following directory:

&lt;App-V Sequencer installation drive&gt; \\**Program Files** \\ **Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer** \\ **Logs**

Install public versions of the required assemblies on the computer running the App-V Sequencer before you sequence the application. The same assemblies must also be installed on all computers running the App-V client before you deploy the package.
