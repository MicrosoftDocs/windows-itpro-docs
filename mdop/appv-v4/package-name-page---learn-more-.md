# Package Name Page (Learn More)


Use the **Package Name** page to specify a name for the virtual application package. You can also configure where the package will reside on the target computers.

**Note**  
Editing the primary virtual application directory is an advanced task.

 

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="virtual-application-package-name"></a>**Virtual Application Package Name**  
Specifies the name that will be associated with virtual application package. The name specified should help identify the purpose and version of the application. The package name is also displayed in the App-V management console.

<a href="" id="edit--advanced-"></a>**Edit (Advanced)**  
Select this option to change the location of where the virtual application will be installed on target computers. Editing the Application Virtualization path is an advanced configuration task. You should fully understand the implications of changing the path. For most applications, we recommend the default path. Only select this option, if you prefer to generate your own file name.
