# About Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 SP1


Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.6 SP1 provides the following enhancements and new features:

-   Improved App-V sequencer – the App-V 4.6 SP1 sequencer has been updated to help improve the sequencing process. The enhancements include a more predictable packaging experience, and help at each step of the sequencing process. Click any of the following links for more information about the new version of the App-V sequencer.

    -   App-V Package Accelerators can be used to automatically sequence large, complex applications. Additionally, when you apply an App-V Package Accelerator, you are not always required to manually install an application to create the virtual application package. For more information about App-V package accelerators, see [About App-V Package Accelerators (App-V 4.6 SP1)](about-app-v-package-accelerators--app-v-46-sp1-.md).

    -   Enhanced support for sequencing different types of applications. For more information about the different types of applications, see [How to Determine Which Type of Application to Sequence (App-V 4.6 SP1)](how-to-determine-which-type-of-application-to-sequence---app-v-46-sp1-.md).

    -   Enhanced support for using App-V project templates. For more information about App-V project templates, see [How to Create an App-V Project Template (App-V 4.6 SP1)](how-to-create-an-app-v-project-template--app-v-46-sp1-.md).

    -   Step-by-step help during sequencing. For an example of the new step-by-step see [Type of Application Page (Learn More)](type-of-application-page--learn-more-.md).

    -   Enhanced reporting to help identify sequencing issues. For an example of the new reporting, see [Files Excluded Page Dialog Box (App-V 4.6 SP1)](files-excluded-page-dialog-box--app-v-46-sp1-.md).

-   Support for using a read-only cache on RDS - App-V 4.6 SP1 now supports using a shared, read-only cache in both VDI and RDS environments. For more information about sharing a read-only cache on RDS, see [How to Configure a Read-only Cache on the App-V Client (RDS)](how-to-configure-a-read-only-cache-on-the-app-v-client--rds--sp1.md).

-   Support for sequencing the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 - App-V 4.6 SP1 now supports sequencing the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.

-   Customer Feedback and Hotfix Rollup – App-V 4.6 SP1 also includes a rollup up of fixes to address issues found since the App-V 4.6 release.
