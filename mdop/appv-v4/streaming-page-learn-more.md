# Streaming Page


Use the **Streaming** page to optimize the virtual application package. During this step, the App-V Sequencer evaluates and configures the virtual application package so that it runs more efficiently when the package is deployed to target computers.

**Note**  
You only have to perform the following tasks if you plan to stream the package across the network.

 

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="run-selected"></a>**Run Selected**  
Runs and optimizes only the specified programs saved in the virtual application package.

<a href="" id="run-all"></a>**Run All**  
Runs all the programs saved in the virtual application package.
