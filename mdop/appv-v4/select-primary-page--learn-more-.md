# Select Primary Page (Learn More)


Use the **Select Primary** page to specify the installation file of the program that the add-on or plug-in will be associated with. If the parent application is not already installed on the computer running the App-V Sequencer, you must stop this procedure and install it now.

For example, if you are installing a plug-in that is designed to operate with Microsoft Excel, you must specify **Excel.exe**.

You can also use an existing virtual application package as the parent application. To use an existing virtual application package, use the following procedure before sequencing the new add-on or plug-in.

1.  To start the App-V Sequencer, on the computer that is running the App-V Sequencer, click **Start** / **All Programs** / **Microsoft Application Virtualization** / **Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer**.

2.  To expand an existing package to the computer running the Sequencer, click **Tools** / **Expand Package to Local System**.

3.  Browse to, and select the package (**.sprj** file) that you want to expand, and then click **Open**.

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="browse"></a>**Browse**  
Click **Browse** to specify the program that the add-in or plug-in you are sequencing will be associated with.
