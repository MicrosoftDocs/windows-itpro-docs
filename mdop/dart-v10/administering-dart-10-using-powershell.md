# Administering DaRT 10 Using PowerShell


Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) 10 lets you use PowerShell commands to complete various DaRT 10 administrative tasks or to create the DaRT recovery image.

## Perform DaRT tasks by using PowerShell commands


DaRT 10 provides four PowerShell commands that let you do the following:

-   Burn an ISO to a CD, DVD, or USB drive.

-   Allow the source WIM file, which contains a DaRT image, to be converted into an ISO file.

-   Create a DaRT configuration object that is needed to apply a DaRT toolset to a Windows Image.

-   Apply a DartConfiguration object to a mounted Windows Image.

## Use a PowerShell script to create the recovery image


Rather than use the DaRT Recovery Image wizard to create the recovery image, you can use a PowerShell script and specify the parameters you want.
