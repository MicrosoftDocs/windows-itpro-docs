# How to Turn the Self-Service Portal Notice Text On or Off


You can turn the Self-Service Portal notice text on or off. By default, the notice text is turned on. To set the notice text, see [How to Set the Self-Service Portal Branding and Session Time-out](how-to-set-the-self-service-portal-branding-and-session-time-out.md).

**Note**  
In the following instructions, *SelfService* is the default virtual directory name for the Self-Service Portal. You might have used a different name when you configured the Self-Service Portal.

 

**To turn off the notice text**

1.  On the server where you configured the Self-Service Portal, browse to **Sites** &gt; **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** &gt; **SelfService** &gt; **Application Settings**.

2.  In the **Name** column, select **DisplayNotice**, and set the value to **false**.
