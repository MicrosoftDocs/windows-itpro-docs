# Deploying the MED-V Workspace Package


After you have tested your Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) 2.0 installer package, you can deploy it throughout your enterprise by using your company’s preferred method of provisioning software and other applications.

**Note**  
When you are ready to deploy, we recommend that you install the MED-V workspace by running the setup.exe executable program that is included in your MED-V workspace installer package.

 

**Warning**  
Before you can install the MED-V workspace, you must first install the MED-V Host Agent.
