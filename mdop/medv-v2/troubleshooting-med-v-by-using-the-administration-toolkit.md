# Troubleshooting MED-V by Using the Administration Toolkit


Use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to troubleshoot certain problems in a MED-V workspace. The MED-V Administration Toolkit lets you access and configure event logs, restart or reset the MED-V workspace, and view the published applications and redirected web addresses in the MED-V workspace. You can also use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to open the MED-V workspace virtual machine in full-screen mode.

## To Open the MED-V Administration Toolkit


Perform the following steps to open the MED-V Administration Toolkit:

1.  On the host computer that contains the MED-V workspace you are troubleshooting, open a Command Prompt window.

2.  Browse to %systemdrive%\\Program Files\\Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization.

3.  At the command prompt, type **MedvHost /toolkit**.

After the MED-V Administration Toolkit opens, you can use the toolkit to help resolve issues in the MED-V workspace found during troubleshooting.
