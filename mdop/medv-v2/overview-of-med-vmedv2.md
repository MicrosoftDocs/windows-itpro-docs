# Overview of MED-V


Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) 2.0 enables the deployment and management of Windows Virtual PC images throughout an enterprise. By providing large-scale deployments of desktops running Windows XP Professional SP3 that are hosted through Windows Virtual PC, MED-V lets businesses upgrade to Windows 7, even though some of their applications might not yet be fully functional or supported.

This guide helps you understand, deploy, and manage your MED-V environment. By using the information provided in this guide, you can plan for and prepare your MED-V deployment, learn how to monitor and manage MED-V workspaces, and understand how to use MED-V to benefit your IT organization.

## Key Scenarios for Using MED-V


Incompatibility of legacy applications together with new versions of Windows can often delay enterprise upgrades to the latest version of Windows. Testing and migrating applications takes time, and users cannot take advantage of the new capabilities and enhancements offered by the newest operating system.

By delivering applications in a Windows Virtual PC that is running Windows XP SP3, MED-V removes the barriers to operating system upgrades and lets administrators complete testing and address incompatible applications after the upgrade.

From the user's perspective, these applications can be accessed from the standard desktop **Start** menu and appear side-by-side with native applications, so there is minimal change to the user experience.
