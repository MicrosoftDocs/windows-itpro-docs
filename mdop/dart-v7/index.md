# Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset 7 Administrator's Guide


Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) 7 lets you diagnose and repair a computer that cannot be started or that has problems starting as expected. By using DaRT, you can recover end-user computers that have become unusable, diagnose probable causes of issues, and quickly repair unbootable or locked-out computers. When it is necessary, you can also quickly restore important lost files and detect and remove malware, even when the computer is not online.

DaRT is an important part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP), a dynamic solution available to Software Assurance customers that helps reduce software installation costs, enables delivery of applications as services, and helps manage and control enterprise desktop environments.
