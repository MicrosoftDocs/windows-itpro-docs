# Accessibility for DaRT 8.0


Microsoft is committed to making its products and services easier for everyone to use. This section provides information about features and services that make this product and its corresponding documentation more accessible for people with disabilities.

## Access any command with a few keystrokes


Access keys let you quickly use a command by pressing a few keys. You can get to most commands by using two keystrokes. To use an access key:

1.  Press ALT.

    The keyboard shortcuts are displayed over each feature that is available in the current view.

2.  Press the letter shown in the keyboard shortcut over the feature that you want to use.

**Note**  
To cancel the action that you are taking and hide the keyboard shortcuts, press ALT.

 

## Documentation in alternative formats


If you have difficulty reading or handling printed materials, you can obtain the documentation for many Microsoft products in more accessible formats. You can view an index of accessible product documentation on the Microsoft Accessibility website. In addition, you can obtain additional Microsoft publications from Learning Ally (formerly Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic, Inc.). Learning Ally distributes these documents to registered, eligible members of their distribution service.
