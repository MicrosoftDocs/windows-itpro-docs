# Planning for MBAM 2.0


The goal of deployment planning is to successfully and efficiently deploy Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) with the Stand-alone topology so that it does not disrupt your users or the network. If you want to install Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring with the Configuration Manager topology, see [Planning to Deploy MBAM with Configuration Manager](planning-to-deploy-mbam-with-configuration-manager-2.md).

You should consider a number of different deployment configurations and prerequisites before you deploy MBAM. This section describes the information that you need to formulate a deployment plan that best meets your business requirements, assists you in preparing your network and computing environment, and provides the information necessary for you to properly plan to deploy MBAM features.
