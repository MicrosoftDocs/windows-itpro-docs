# Privacy Statement for MBAM 1.0


## Privacy Statement


At Microsoft, we're working hard to protect your privacy while delivering products that bring you the performance, power, and convenience that you want in your personal computing. This privacy statement explains many of the data collection and use practices of Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM). This privacy statement focuses on features that communicate with the Internet and is not intended to be an exhaustive list. This privacy statement does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services.

Collection and Use of Your Personal Information:

When we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you, we will explicitly ask you for it. The personal information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized, and may also be used to request additional information on feedback that you provide about the product or service that you are using; to provide critical updates and notifications regarding the software; to improve the product or service, for example bug and survey form inquiries, or to provide you with advance notice of events or to tell you about new product releases.

Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a Microsoft site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. Microsoft may disclose personal information about you if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft (including enforcing our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, users of Microsoft products or services, or members of the public.

Collection and Use of Information about Your Computer:

Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring contains Internet-enabled features that can collect certain standard information from your computer ("standard computer information") along with information needed for a specific feature and send it to Microsoft. Standard computer information includes information such as your IP address, operating system version, a code that identifies the manufacturer of your computer, and your regional and language settings. This computer information is generally not personally identifiable.

Security of Your Information:

Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.

Changes to the Privacy Statement:

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.
