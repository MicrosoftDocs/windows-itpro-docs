# Creating a MED-V Workspace


A MED-V workspace is the desktop environment in which end users interact with the virtual machine provided by MED-V. The MED-V workspace is created and customized by the administrator. It consists of an image and the policy, which defines the rules and functionality of the MED-V workspace. Multiple MED-V workspaces can be created, each customized with its own configuration, settings, and rules. A user, group, or multiple users or groups can be associated with each MED-V workspace, thereby making the MED-V workspace available only for the associated user's or group's computers.

## How to Add a MED-V Workspace


**To add a MED-V workspace**

1.  Click the **Policy** management button to open the **Policy** module.

    The **Policy** module consists of the **Workspaces** menu on the left and the **General**, **Virtual Machine**, **Deployment**, **Applications**, **Web**, **VM Setup**, **Network**, and **Performance** tabs.

2.  On the **Policy** menu, select **New Workspace**, or click **Add** to create a new MED-V workspace.

5.  In the **Support contact info** field, enter the contact information for technical support.

    For more information about configuring a MED-V workspace, see [Configuring MED-V Workspace Policies](configuring-med-v-workspace-policies.md).

    A new MED-V workspace is created with the name &lt;Original MED-V workspace name&gt; - 2.
