## In This Section


This section describes how to configure a MED-V image on a computer on which the MED-V client and MED-V management application are installed, and explains the following:

<a href="" id="how-to-pack-a-med-v-image"></a>[How to Pack a MED-V Image](how-to-pack-a-med-v-image.md)  
Describes how to pack a MED-V image so that it can be added to a deployment package or uploaded to the server.

<a href="" id="how-to-upload-a-med-v-image-to-the-server"></a>[How to Upload a MED-V Image to the Server](how-to-upload-a-med-v-image-to-the-server.md)  
Describes how to upload a MED-V image to the server.

<a href="" id="how-to-localize-a-med-v-image"></a>[How to Localize a MED-V Image](how-to-localize-a-med-v-image.md)  
Describes how to localize a MED-V image either through extracting or downloading the image.

<a href="" id="how-to-update-a-med-v-image"></a>[How to Update a MED-V Image](how-to-update-a-med-v-image.md)

**Note**  
After the MED-V image is configured, the computer should not be part of a domain because the join domain procedure should be performed on the client after the deployment, as part of the MED-V workspace setup.
