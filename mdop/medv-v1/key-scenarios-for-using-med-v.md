# Key Scenarios for Using MED-V


## Enable Legacy Applications and Accelerate Upgrades to New Operating Systems


Incompatibility of legacy applications with new versions of Windows can often delay enterprise upgrades to the latest version of Windows. Testing and migrating applications takes time, and users are unable to take advantage of the new capabilities and enhancements offered by the newest operating system.

By delivering applications in a Virtual PC that runs a previous version of the operating system (for example, Windows XP or Windows 2000), MED-V removes the barriers to operating system upgrades and allows administrators to complete testing and address incompatible applications after the upgrade.

From the user's perspective, these applications are accessible from the standard desktop Start menu and appear side-by-side with native applications—so there is minimal change to the user experience.
