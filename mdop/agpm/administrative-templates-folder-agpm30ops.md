# Administrative Templates Folder


The Administrative template settings for Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) enable you to centrally configure logging and tracing options for AGPM Clients and AGPM Servers to which a Group Policy Object (GPO) with these settings is applied. Similarly, these settings enable you to centrally configure archive locations and the visibility of the **Change Control** folder and **History** tab for Group Policy administrators to whom a GPO with these settings is applied.
