# What's New in AGPM 3.0


Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) 3.0 includes the following new or changed features:

-   More detailed information in the History of each GPO

-   Ability to delegate access to the production environment from AGPM

-   Ability to limit the number of GPO versions stored in the archive

-   Ability to configure e-mail security for AGPM

-   Friendlier names for AGPM policy settings

-   The Editor role now requires permission to delete GPOs from the archive

Additionally, AGPM 3.0 is localized for the following languages:

-   Chinese (Simplified)

### Additional considerations

AGPM 3.0 supports Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista with SP1. It does not support Windows Server 2003 or Windows Vista with no service packs installed. AGPM 2.5 supports those environments.
