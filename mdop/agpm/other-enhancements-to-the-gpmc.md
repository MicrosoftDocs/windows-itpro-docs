# Other Enhancements to the GPMC


Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) adds a **History** tab and an **Extensions** tab to extend the functionality of the **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC).

## History tab


AGPM adds a **History** tab to all Group Policy objects (GPOs) and Group Policy links displayed in the GPMC. The features of the **History** tab in the details pane of a GPO are the same as those of the **History** window displayed through the **Change Control** tab. For information about these features, see [History Window](history-window.md).

## Extensions tab


In the Microsoft Windows Server® 2003 operating system, AGPM adds an **Extensions** tab to all GPOs and Group Policy links displayed in the GPMC. This tab lists all extensions that have settings in the GPO (or all registered extensions if **Show all registered extensions** is checked) and identifies them as part of the user or computer context.
