# Deleting, Restoring, or Destroying a GPO


As an Approver, you can delete a Group Policy Object (GPO) (moving it to the Recycle Bin), restore a GPO from the Recycle Bin (returning it to the archive), or destroy a GPO (permanently deleting it so that it can no longer be restored).

-   [Delete a Controlled GPO](delete-a-controlled-gpo-agpm40.md)

-   [Restore a Deleted GPO](restore-a-deleted-gpo-agpm40.md)

-   [Destroy a GPO](destroy-a-gpo-agpm40.md)
