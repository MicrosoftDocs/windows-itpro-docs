# Performing Reviewer Tasks


A Reviewer is a person authorized by an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to review or audit Group Policy Objects (GPOs). An individual with only the Reviewer role cannot modify GPOs; however, all other roles include the Reviewer role.

-   [Review GPO Settings](review-gpo-settings-agpm30ops.md)

-   [Review GPO Links](review-gpo-links-agpm30ops.md)

-   [Identify Differences Between GPOs, GPO Versions, or Templates](identify-differences-between-gpos-gpo-versions-or-templates-agpm30ops.md)

### Additional considerations
