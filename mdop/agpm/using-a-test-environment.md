# Using a Test Environment


Before you request that a Group Policy Object (GPO) be deployed to the production environment, you should test the GPO in a lab environment. If you develop the GPO in a domain in a test forest, you can export the GPO to a file and import the file to a domain in the production forest. You can then test the GPO by linking it to an organizational unit (OU) that contains test computers and users.

-   [Export a GPO to a File](export-a-gpo-to-a-file.md)

-   [Import a GPO from a File](import-a-gpo-from-a-file-ed.md)

-   [Test a GPO in a Separate Organizational Unit](test-a-gpo-in-a-separate-organizational-unit-agpm40.md)

**Note**  
You can also import a GPO from the production environment of the domain. For more information, see [Import a GPO from Production](import-a-gpo-from-production-agpm40-ed.md).
