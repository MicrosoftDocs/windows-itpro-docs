# Creating, Controlling, or Importing a GPO


To use Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) to provide change control for a Group Policy object (GPO), you must first control the GPO with AGPM. New GPOs created through the **Change Control** node will automatically be controlled.

-   [Control a Previously Uncontrolled GPO](control-a-previously-uncontrolled-gpo.md)

-   [Create a New Controlled GPO](create-a-new-controlled-gpo.md)

-   [Delegate Access to a GPO](delegate-access-to-a-gpo.md)

-   [Import a GPO from Production](import-a-gpo-from-production-approver.md)
