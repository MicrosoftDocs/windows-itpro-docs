# User Interface: Advanced Group Policy Management


Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) adds a **Change Control** node to each domain displayed in the **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC). In an environment where multiple domains are managed with the GPMC, each domain is listed under the **Domains** node in the console tree. Each domain has a **Change Control** node under it, and there is one archive of Group Policy objects (GPOs) per domain.

Within the details pane there are three primary tabs, providing access to both GPO-level settings and domain-level settings and commands for AGPM.

-   [Contents Tab](contents-tab.md): GPO settings and commands and GPO-level delegation

-   [Domain Delegation Tab](domain-delegation-tab.md): AGPM e-mail notification settings and domain-level delegation

-   [AGPM Server Tab](agpm-server-tab.md): Domain-level archive connection settings

Other enhancements and settings:

-   [Administrative Template Settings](administrative-template-settings.md): Central configuration of logging and tracing, archive locations, and the visibility of features

-   [Other Enhancements to the GPMC](other-enhancements-to-the-gpmc.md): AGPM adds a **History** tab and an **Extensions** tab for each GPO and Group Policy link
