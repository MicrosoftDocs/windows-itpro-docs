# Managing the Archive


In Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), as an AGPM Administrator (Full Control), you manage access to the archive and have the option to limit the number of versions of each Group Policy Object (GPO) stored in the archive. You can delegate access to GPOs in the archive at the domain level or GPO level.

-   [Delegate Access to an Individual GPO in the Archive](delegate-access-to-an-individual-gpo-in-the-archive-agpm30ops.md)

-   [Limit the GPO Versions Stored](limit-the-gpo-versions-stored-agpm30ops.md)

-   [Back Up the Archive](back-up-the-archive.md)

-   [Restore the Archive from a Backup](restore-the-archive-from-a-backup.md)
