# Planning for UE-V Configuration


You can configure Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) to meet the specific needs of your enterprise by defining which applications are deployed and which configurations define the UE-V behavior.

## Plan which applications to synchronize with UE-V


UE-V includes a set of predefined settings location templates. UE-V also allows administrators to create custom settings location templates for other applications, including third-party or line-of-business applications that are used in the enterprise. This topic includes a list of applications that are included with the UE-V client and guidance on how to include custom settings location templates.

## Plan custom template deployment


In order to support other applications, including third-party applications, you must create custom settings location templates by using the UE-V Generator, and deploy them to a settings template catalog.

## Plan for UE-V configuration


UE-V configurations determine how settings are synchronized throughout the enterprise. These configurations can be made before, during, or after the UE-V Agent is deployed. UE-V provides a variety of configuration methods
