# Installing the UE-V Generator


The Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) generator can be installed on a computer and used to create a custom settings location template. This computer should have the applications installed for which custom settings location templates will be generated. To install the UE-V Generator, run **ToolsSetup.exe**. If the architecture of the computer is known, then you can run the appropriate Windows Installer (.msi) file, **ToolsSetupx64.msi** or **ToolsSetupx86.msi**.

**To install the UE-V Generator**

1.  As a user with local computer administrator rights, locate the UE-V Generator installation file (ToolSetup.exe) provided with the User Experience Virtualization software.

2.  Double-click the installation file. The User Experience Virtualization Generator Setup wizard opens. Click **Next** to continue.

3.  Accept the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then click **Next**.

4.  Specify the options for Microsoft Updates and the Customer Experience Improvement Program.

5.  Select the destination folder in which the UE-V Generator will be installed, and then click **Next**.

6.  Click **Install** to begin the installation.

    **Note**  
    A prompt for User Account Control appears before the application is installed. Permission is required to install the UE-V generator.

     

7.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard after the installation is complete. You will need to restart your computer before you can run the UE-V Generator.

    To verify that the installation was successful, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft User Experience Virtualization**, and then click **Microsoft User Experience Virtualization Generator**.
