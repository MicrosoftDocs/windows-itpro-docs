# Browser User Interface: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Browser User Interface** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you change the toolbar buttons and the title bar text in IE.

**Note**  
The customizations you make on this page apply only to Internet Explorer for the desktop.

 

![](images/wedge.gif)**To use the Browser User Interface page**

1.  Check the **Customize Title Bars** box so you can add your custom text to the **Title Bar Text** box.

    The text shows up in the title bar as **IE provided by &lt;** *your custom text***&gt;**.

2.  Check the **Delete existing toolbar buttons, if present** box so you can delete all of the toolbar buttons in your employee’s browser, except for the standard buttons installed with IE (which can’t be removed).

    **Note**  
    Only Administrators can use this option.

     

3.  Click **Add** to add new toolbar buttons.

    The **Browser Toolbar Button Information** box appears.

4.  In the **Toolbar caption** box, type the text that shows up when an employee hovers over your custom button. We recommend no more than 10 characters.

5.  In the **Toolbar action** box, browse to your script or executable file that runs when an employee clicks your custom button.

6.  In the **Toolbar icon** box, browse to the icon file that represents your button while active. This icon must be 20x20 pixels.

7.  Check the **This button should be shown on the toolbar by default** box so your custom button shows by default.

    This box should be cleared if you want to offer a custom set of buttons, but want your employees to choose whether or not to use them. In this situation, your buttons will show up in the **Customize Toolbars** dialog box, under **Available toolbar buttons**. Your employees can get to this dialog box in IE by clicking **Tools** from the **Command Bar**, clicking **Toolbars**, and then clicking **Customize**.

8.  Click **OK.**

9.  Click **Edit** to change your custom toolbar button or **Remove** to delete the button. The removed button will disappear from your employee’s computer after you apply the updated customization. Only custom toolbar buttons can be removed.

10. Click **Next** to go to the [Search Providers: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](search-providers-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [User Experience: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](user-experience-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md).
