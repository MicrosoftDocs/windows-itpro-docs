# Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you add:

-   **Links.** Used so your employees can quickly connect with your important websites. These links can appear in the **Links** folder or on the **Favorites Bar**.

-   **Web Slices.** Used so your employees can subscribe to a section of a webpage, tracking information as it changes, such as for weather reports, stock prices, or the progress of an auction item.

-   **Feeds.** Used so your employees can quickly access your recommended RSS feeds. While you can’t import a folder of RSS feeds, you can add new links.

Although we provide default items in the **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** area, you can remove any of the items, add more items, or add new folders and links as part of your custom package. The customizations you make on this page only apply to Internet Explorer for the desktop.
