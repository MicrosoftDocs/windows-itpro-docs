# What is the Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit?

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

The Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit lets you turn off the automatic delivery of IE11 through the **Automatic Updates** feature of Windows Update.

**Important**<br>
The IE11 Blocker Toolkit doesn't stop users from manually installing IE11 from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=327753). Also, even if you've installed previous versions of the toolkit before, like for Internet Explorer 10, you still need to install this version to prevent the installation of IE11.

**To install the toolkit**

1.  Download the IE11 Blocker Toolkit from [Toolkit to Disable Automatic Delivery of Internet Explorer 11](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=327745).

2.  Accept the license agreement and store the included 4 files on your local computer.

3.  Start an elevated Command Prompt by going to **Start**&gt;**All Programs**&gt;**Accessories**&gt; right-clicking on **Command Prompt**, and then choosing **Run as Administrator**.

4.  In the Command Prompt, change to the location where you put the 4 files.

5.  In the Command Prompt, type `ie11_blocker.cmd /B` and press Enter.<p>
Wait for the message, **Blocking deployment of IE11 on the local machine. The operation completed successfully.**

6.  Close the Command Prompt.
