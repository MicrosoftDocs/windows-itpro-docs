If you need to replace your entire site list because of errors, or simply because it’s out of date, you can import your exported Enterprise Mode site list using the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>Importing your file overwrites everything that’s currently in the tool, so make sure it’s what want to do.

1.  In the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager, click **File \> Import**.

2.  Go to the exported .EMIE file.<p>For example, `C:\users\<user_name>\documents\sites.emie`

1.  Click **Open**.

2.  Review the alert message about all of your entries being overwritten and click **Yes**.
