# Remove sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

Remove websites that were added to a local Enterprise Mode site list by mistake or because the sites no longer have compatibility problems.

**Note**<br>The changes described in this topic only impact sites added to a local Enterprise Mode site list and not the list of sites deployed to all employees by an administrator. Employees can't delete sites added to the list by an administrator.

  **To remove single sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list**

1.  Open Internet Explorer 11 and go to the site you want to remove.

2.  Click **Tools**, and then click **Enterprise Mode**.<p>
The checkmark disappears from next to Enterprise Mode and the site is removed from the list.

**Note**<br>If the site is removed by mistake, it can be added back by clicking **Enterprise Mode** again.

 **To remove all sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list**

1.  Open IE11, click **Tools**, and then click **Internet options**.

2.  Click the **Delete** button from the **Browsing history** area.

3.  Click the box next to **Cookies and website data**, and then click **Delete**.

**Note**<br>This removes all of the sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list.
