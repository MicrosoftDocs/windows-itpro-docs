Remove websites that were added to a local Enterprise Mode site list by mistake or because the sites no longer have compatibility problems.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes described in this topic only impact sites added to a local Enterprise Mode site list and not the list of sites deployed to all employees by an administrator. Employees can't delete sites added to the list by an administrator.

**To remove single sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list**

1.  Open Internet Explorer 11 and go to the site you want to remove.

2.  Click **Tools**, and then click **Enterprise Mode**.

    The checkmark disappears from next to Enterprise Mode and the site is removed from the list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the site is removed by mistake, it can be added back by clicking **Enterprise Mode** again.

**To remove all sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list**

1.  Open Internet Explorer 11, click **Tools**, and then click **Internet options**.

2.  Click the **Delete** button from the **Browsing history** area.

3.  Click the box next to **Cookies and website data**, and then click **Delete**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This removes all of the sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list.
