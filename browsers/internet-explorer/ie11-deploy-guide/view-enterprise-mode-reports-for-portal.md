Administrators can view the Microsoft-provided Enterprise Mode reports from the Enterprise Mode Site List Portal.

**To view the reports**
1. Open the Enterprise Mode Site List Portal and click the **Enterprise Mode reports** icon in the upper-right area of the page.

    The **Enterprise Mode reports** page appears, with each app showing its URL, the compatibility mode to use, and the assigned browser to open the site.

2. Use the calendars to provide the **From date** and **To date**, determining the span of time the report covers.

3. Click **Apply**.

    The reports all change to reflect the appropriate timeframe and group, including:

    - **Total number of websites in the site list.** A box at the top of the reports page that tells you the total number of websites included in the Enterprise Mode Sit List.

    - **All websites by docmode.** Shows how many change requests exist, based on the different doc modes included in the **App best viewed in** field.

    - **All websites by browser.** Shows how many apps require which browser, including **IE11**, **MSEdge**, or **None**.

    - **All requests by status.** Shows how many change requests exist, based on each status.

    - **All requests by change type.** Shows how many change requests exist, based on the **Requested change** field.

    - **Request status by group.** Shows how many change requests exist, based on both group and status.

    - **Reasons for request.** Shows how many change request reasons exist, based on the **Reason for request** field.

    - **Requested changes by app name.** Shows what specific apps were **Added to site list**, **Deleted from site list**, or **Updated from site list**.
