# Deploy Internet Explorer 11 using software distribution tools

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 workloads end of support for IE11](../includes/microsoft-365-ie-end-of-support.md)]

If you already manage software distribution and updates on your network through software distribution tools, you can also use these tools for ongoing deployments of Internet Explorer. Software distribution tools include:

-   **Configuration Manager** Deploy and install Internet Explorer 11 on your user's computers through a software distribution package. For more information about using this tool, see [Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682129(v=technet.10)).

-   **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).** Download a single copy of the IE11 updates, caching them to local servers so your users' computers can receive the updates directly from the WSUS servers, instead of through Windows Update. For more information about using this tool, see [Windows Server Update Services](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh852345(v=ws.11)).

-   **Group Policy Software Installation.** Deploy and install IE11 on your user's computers through a combination of Group Policy and Microsoft Active Directory. For more information about using this tool, see [Group Policy Software Installation overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc738858(v=ws.10)).

-   **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT).** Add the IE11 update to your deployment share, using MDT to update your previously-deployed Windows image. For more information about using this tool, see [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)](/mem/configmgr/mdt/).
