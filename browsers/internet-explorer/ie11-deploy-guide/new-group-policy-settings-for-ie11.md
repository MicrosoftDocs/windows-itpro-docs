SPDY/3 works with HTTP requests to optimize the latency of network requests through compression, multiplexing and prioritization.<p>If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer uses the SPDY/3 network protocol.<p>If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer won't use the SPDY/3 network protocol.<p>If you don't configure this policy setting, users can turn this behavior on or off, on the **Advanced\* tab of the \*\*Internet Options** dialog box. The default is on.<p>**Note**<br>We've replaced the SPDY/3 protocol with the HTTP2 protocol in Windows 10. You can configure the HTTP2 protocol by using the **Allow IE to use the HTTP2 network protocol** setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Optionally, this policy also lets you specify where to get reports (through post messages) about the websites for which users turn on Enterprise Mode using the **Tools** menu.<p>If you enable this policy setting, users can see and use the **Enterprise Mode** option from the **Tools** menu. If you enable this setting, but don’t specify a report location, Enterprise Mode will still be available to your users, but you won’t get any reports.<p>If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, the menu option won’t appear and users won’t be able to turn on Enterprise Mode locally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Users can’t edit this list.<p>If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer downloads the Enterprise Mode website list from the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\EnterpriseMode hive, opening all included websites using Enterprise Mode. We recommend storing and downloading your list from a secure web server `(https://)`, to help protect against data tampering.<p>If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer opens all websites using **Standard** mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Removed Group Policy settings
IE11 no longer supports these Group Policy settings:

-   Turn on Internet Explorer 7 Standards Mode

-   Turn off Compatibility View button

-   Turn off Quick Tabs functionality

-   Turn off the quick pick menu

-   Use large icons for command buttons

## Viewing your policy settings
After you've finished updating and deploying your Group Policy, you can use the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) snap-in to view your settings.

**To use the RSoP snap-in**

1.  Open and run the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) wizard, specifying the information you want to see.

2.  Open your wizard results in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).<p>
For complete instructions about how to add, open, and use RSoP, see [Use the RSoP Snap-in](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc736424(v=ws.10))
