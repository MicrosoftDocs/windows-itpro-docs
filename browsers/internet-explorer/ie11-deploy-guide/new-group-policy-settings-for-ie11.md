# New group policy settings for Internet Explorer 11
Internet Explorer 11 gives you some new Group Policy settings to help you manage your company's web browser configurations, including:

|Policy |Category Path |Supported on |Explanation |
|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|
|Allow IE to use the HTTP2 network protocol |Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer\Internet Control Panel\Advanced Page |IE11 on Windows 10 |This policy setting determines whether IE uses the HTTP2 network protocol. HTTP2 works with HTTP requests to optimize the latency of network requests through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.<p>If you enable this policy setting, IE uses the HTTP2 network protocol.<p>If you disable this policy setting, IE won't use the HTTP2 network protocol.<p>If you don't configure this policy setting, users can turn this behavior on or off, using the **Internet Explorer Advanced Internet Options** settings. The default is on. |
|Allow IE to use the SPDY/3 network protocol |Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer\Internet Control Panel\Advanced Page |IE11 on Windows 10 |This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer uses the SPDY/3 network protocol. SPDY/3 works with HTTP requests to optimize the latency of network requests through compression, multiplexing and prioritization.<p>If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer uses the SPDY/3 network protocol.<p>If you disable this policy setting, Internet Explorer won't use the SPDY/3 network protocol.<p>If you don't configure this policy setting, users can turn this behavior on or off, on the **Advanced* tab of the **Internet Options** dialog box. The default is on.<p>**Note**<br>We've replaced the SPDY/3 protocol with the HTTP2 protocol in Windows 10. You can configure the HTTP2 protocol by using the **Allow IE to use the HTTP2 network protocol** setting. |
|Allow Microsoft services to provide enhanced suggestions as the user types in the Address bar |Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer |IE11 on Windows 10 |This policy setting allows IE to provide enhanced suggestions as the user types in the Address bar. To provide enhanced suggestions, the user’s keystrokes are sent to Microsoft through Microsoft services.<p>If you enable this policy setting, users receive enhanced suggestions while typing in the Address bar. In addition, users won’t be able to change the **Suggestions** setting on the **Settings** charm.<p>If you disable this policy setting, users won’t receive enhanced suggestions while typing in the Address bar. In addition, users won’t be able to change the **Suggestions** setting on the **Settings** charm.<p>If you don’t configure this policy setting, users can change the **Suggestions** setting on the **Settings** charm. |

By default, the TDC ActiveX Control is disabled in the **Internet** and **Restricted Sites** security zones.<p>If you enable this policy setting, users won’t be able to run the TDC ActiveX control from all sites in the specified zone.<p>If you disable this policy setting, users can run the TDC Active X control from all sites in the specified zone. |
|Allow SSL3 Fallback |Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer\Security Features |Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10 |This policy setting allows you to stop websites from falling back to using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 3.0 or lower, if Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 or higher, fails. This setting doesn’t affect which security protocols are enabled.<p>If you enable this policy setting and a website fails while using the TLS 1.0 or higher security protocols, Internet Explorer will try to fallback and use SSL 3.0 or lower security protocols.<p>If you disable or don’t configure this setting, Internet Explorer uses the default system protocols.<p>**Important:**<br>By default, SSL 3.0 is disabled. If you choose to enable SSL 3.0, we recommend that you disable or don't configure this setting to help mitigate potential man-in-the-middle attacks. |
