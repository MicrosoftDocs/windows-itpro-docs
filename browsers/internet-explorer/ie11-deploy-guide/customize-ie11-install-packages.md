In addition, you can configure IE before, during, or after deployment, using these tools:

-   **IE Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11)**. Creates customized installation packages that can be deployed through your software distribution system. For more information about the IEAK 11, see [Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) - Administration Guide for IT Pros](../ie11-ieak/index.md).

-   **Group Policy**. Configures and enforces IE11 settings. For more information about settings and configuration options, see [Group policy objects and Internet Explorer 11 (IE11)](group-policy-objects-and-ie11.md).

-   **Unattend.xml**. Customizes some of the IE settings during your Windows installation. This option only applies if you're updating a Windows image with IE11.<p>**Note**<br>
You'll only see the new IE11 Unattend.xml settings if your Unattend.xml file's associated with a Windows image that includes the IE11 update. For more information about editing and using the Unattend.xml file, see [Unattended Windows Setup Reference](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/ff699026(v=win.10)). For more information about using the Windows System Image Manager, see [Windows System Image Manager Technical Reference](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh824929(v=win.10)).
