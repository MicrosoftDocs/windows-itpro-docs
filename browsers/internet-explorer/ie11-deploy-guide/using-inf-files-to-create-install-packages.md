# Using Setup Information (.inf) files to create install packages

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 workloads end of support for IE11](../includes/microsoft-365-ie-end-of-support.md)]

IEAKÂ 11 uses Setup information (.inf) files to provide uninstallation instructions. Uninstallation instructions let your employees remove components, like files, registry entries, or shortcuts, through the **Uninstall or change a program** box. For details about .inf files, see [INF File Sections and Directives](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/).

 **To add uninstallation instructions to the .inf files**

- Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) and add these registry keys:
  ```
  HKLM,SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\app-name,"DisplayName",,"description"
  HKLM,SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\app-name,"UninstallString",,"command-line"
  ```
  Where **"description"** is the name that shows up in the **Uninstall or change a program** box and **"command-line"** is the command that runs after the component is picked.
  <p><strong>Note</strong><br>
  Make sure your script removes the uninstallation registry key, too. Otherwise, the component name will continue to show up in the <strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong>.

## Limitations
.Inf files have limitations:

-   You can't delete directories.

-   You can't use **RenFiles** to move a file to a different location, it only lets you rename a file in its existing location. For detailed information, see [INF RenFiles Directive](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-renfiles-directive).

-   You can't use **CopyFiles** to copy a file to another place on your hard drive, it can only copy files from the source disk to the destination directory. For information, see [INF CopyFiles Directive](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-copyfiles-directive).
