# Missing Internet Explorer Maintenance settings for Internet Explorer 11

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 workloads end of support for IE11](../includes/microsoft-365-ie-end-of-support.md)]


**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

The Internet Explorer Maintenance (IEM) settings have been deprecated in favor of Group Policy Preferences, Administrative Templates (.admx), and the IE Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11).

Because of this change, your IEM-configured settings will no longer work on computers running Internet Explorer 10 or newer. To fix this, you need to update the affected settings using Group Policy Preferences, Administrative Templates (.admx), or IE Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11).

Because Group Policy Preferences and IEAK 11 run using asynchronous processes, you should choose to use only one of the tools within each group of settings. For example, using only IEAK 11 in the **Security** settings or Group Policy Preferences within the **Internet Zone** settings. Also, it's important to remember that policy is enforced and can't be changed by the user, while preferences are configured, but can be changed by the user.

For more information about all of the new options and Group Policy, see:
