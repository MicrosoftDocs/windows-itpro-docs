# Group Policy and ActiveX installation

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 workloads end of support for IE11](../includes/microsoft-365-ie-end-of-support.md)]


ActiveX controls are installed and invoked using the HTML object tag with the CODEBASE attribute. This attribute, through a URL, makes Internet Explorer:

-   Get the ActiveX control if it's not already installed.

-   Download the installation package.

-   Perform trust verification on the object.

-   Prompt for installation permission, using the IE Information Bar.

During installation, the rendering page registers and invokes the control, so that after installation, any standard user can invoke the control.

**Important**<br>ActiveX control installation requires administrator-level permissions.

## Group Policy for the ActiveX Installer Service

You use the ActiveX Installer Service (AXIS) and Group Policy to manage your ActiveX control deployment. The AXIS-related settings can be changed using either the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or the Local Group Policy Editor, and include:

-   **Approved Installation Sites for ActiveX Controls.** A list of approved installation sites used by AXIS to determine whether it can install a particular ActiveX control.

-   **ActiveX installation policy for sites in trusted zones.** Identifies how AXIS should behave when a website tries to install an ActiveX control. First, AXIS looks to see if the site appears in either the list of approved installation sites or in the **Trusted sites** zone. If the does, then AXIS checks to make sure the control meets your company's policy requirements. If the ActiveX control meets all of these requirements, the control is installed.
