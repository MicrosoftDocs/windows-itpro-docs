# Export your Enterprise Mode site list from the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

After you create your Enterprise Mode site list in the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager, you can export the contents to an Enterprise Mode (.EMIE) file. This file includes all of your URLs, including your compatibility mode selections and should be stored somewhere safe. If your list gets deleted by mistake you can easily import this file and return everything back to when this file was last saved.

**Important**<br> 
This file is not intended for distribution to your managed devices. Instead, it is only for transferring data and comments from one manager to another. For example, if one administrator leaves and passes the existing data to another administrator. Internet Explorer doesn’t read this file.

 **To export your compatibility list**

1.  On the **File** menu of the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager, click **Export**.

2.  Export the file to your selected location. For example, `C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\sites.emie`.
