# Group Policy, Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), and Internet Explorer 11
Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) is an add-on license that available for the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP). This license gives you change control and a role assignment-model that helps optimize Group Policy management and reduce the risk of widespread failures.

From AGPM you can:

-   **Edit GPOs outside of your production environment.** Your GPOs are stored in an outside archive for editing, reviewing, and approving. Then, when you deploy, AGPM moves the GPOs to your production environment.

-   **Assign roles to your employees.** You can assign 3 roles to your employees or groups, including:

    -   **Reviewer.** Can view and compare GPOs in the archive. This role can't edit or deploy GPOs.

    -   **Editor.** Can view, compare, check-in and out, and edit GPOs in the archive. This role can also request GPO deployment.

    -   **Approver.** Can approve GPO creation and deployment to the production environment.

-   **Manage your GPO lifecycle with change control features.** You can use the available version-control, history, and auditing features to help you manage your GPOs while moving through your archive, to your editing process, and finally to your GPO deployment.
