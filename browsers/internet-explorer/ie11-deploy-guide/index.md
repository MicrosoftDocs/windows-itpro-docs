|[Collect data using Enterprise Site Discovery](collect-data-using-enterprise-site-discovery.md) |Use IE to collect data on computers running Windows Internet Explorer 8 through IE11 on Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 7. This inventory information helps you build a list of websites used by your company so you can make more informed decisions about your IE deployments, including figuring out which sites might be at risk or require overhauls during future upgrades. |

|[Out-of-date ActiveX control blocking](out-of-date-activex-control-blocking.md) |ActiveX controls are small apps that let websites provide content, like videos, games, and let you interact with content like toolbars. Unfortunately, because many ActiveX controls aren’t automatically updated, they can become outdated as new versions are released. It’s important that you keep your ActiveX controls up-to-date because malicious software (or malware) can target security flaws in outdated controls, damaging your computer by collecting info from it, installing unwanted software, or by letting someone else control it remotely. To help avoid this situation, IE includes a new security feature, called <em>out-of-date ActiveX control blocking</em>. |
|[Deprecated document modes and Internet Explorer 11](deprecated-document-modes.md) |Internet Explorer 8 introduced document modes as a way to move from the proprietary coding of web features to a more standardized type of coding that could run on multiple browsers and devices. Starting with Windows 10, we’re deprecating document modes.<p>This means that while IE11 will continue to support document modes, Microsoft Edge won’t. And because of that, it also means that if you want to use Microsoft Edge, you’re going to have to update your legacy webpages and apps to support modern features, browsers, and devices.<p><b>Note</b><br>For specific details about the technologies and APIs that are no longer supported in Microsoft Edge, see [A break from the past, part 2: Saying goodbye to ActiveX, VBScript, attachEvent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615953). |
|[What is the Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit?](what-is-the-internet-explorer-11-blocker-toolkit.md) |The IE11 Blocker Toolkit lets you turn off the automatic delivery of IE11 through the <b>Automatic Updates</b> feature of Windows Update. |
|[Missing Internet Explorer Maintenance (IEM) settings for Internet Explorer 11](missing-internet-explorer-maintenance-settings-for-ie11.md) |The Internet Explorer Maintenance (IEM) settings have been deprecated in favor of Group Policy preferences, Administrative Templates (.admx), and the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11).<p>Because of this change, your IEM-configured settings will no longer work on computers running Internet Explorer 10 or newer. To fix this, you need to update the affected settings using Group Policy preferences, Administrative Templates (.admx), or the IEAK 11.<p>Because Group Policy Preferences and IEAK 11 run using asynchronous processes, you should choose to use only one of the tools within each group of settings. For example, using only IEAK 11 in the <b>Security</b> settings or Group Policy Preferences within the <b>Internet Zone</b> settings. Also, it's important to remember that policy is enforced and can't be changed by the user, while preferences are configured, but can be changed by the user. |
|[Missing the Compatibility View Button](missing-the-compatibility-view-button.md) |Compatibility View was introduced in Internet Explorer 8 to help existing content continue to work with Windows Internet Explorer 7, while developers updated their content to support modern interoperable web standards. Since then, the IE web platform, and the web itself, have changed so that most public web content looks for standards-based features instead of IE 7-compatible behavior.<p>Thanks to these changes, using IE11 in the latest standards mode is more compatible with the web than ever before. As a result, IE11 simplifies web page compatibility for users by removing the <b>Compatibility View</b> button and reducing the number of compatibility options in the F12 developer tools for developers. |
|[Deploy pinned websites using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013](deploy-pinned-sites-using-mdt-2013.md) |You can pin websites to the Windows 8.1 taskbar for quick access. You pin a website simply by dragging its tab to the taskbar. Some websites can also extend the icon’s Jump List.<p>The ability to pin websites to the Windows 8.1 taskbar can help make end-users in businesses more productive. As an IT professional, for example, you can pin intranet and SharePoint websites to the taskbar to make them immediately available to employees. In this article, you learn how to deploy pinned websites by using Lite Touch Installation in the [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013](/mem/configmgr/mdt/).
