# Use the Search Providers page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Search Providers** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you add a default search provider (typically, Bing®) and additional providers to your custom version of IE.

**Note**<br>The Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 offers improved and extended search settings. However, you can still optionally include support for Search Suggestions and Favicons, as well as Accelerator previews by using an .ins file from a previous version of IEAK.

**To use the Search Providers page**

1.  Click **Import** to automatically import your existing search providers from your current version of IE into this list.

2.  Click **Add** to add more providers.<p>
The **Search Provider** box appears.

3.  In the **Display Name** box, type the text that appears in the **Search Options** menu for the search provider.

4.  In the **URL** box, type the full URL to the search provider, including the https:// prefix.

5.  In the **Favicon URL** box, type the full URL to any icon to associate with your provider.

6.  In the **Suggestions URL (XML)** box, type the associated search suggestions in XML format.

7.  In the **Suggestions URL (JSON)** box, type the associated search suggestions in JavaScript Object Notation format.

8.  In the **Accelerator Preview URL** box, type the associated Accelerator preview URL for each provider, if it’s necessary.

9.  Check the **Display Search Suggestions for this provider** box to turn on search suggestions for the provider, and then click **OK**.

10. Check the **Search Guide URL Customization** box if you’re going to add your search providers to a custom webpage for your employees. Then, type the URL to the custom webpage in the text box.

11. Click **Edit** to change your search provider information, click **Set Default** to make a search provider the default for your employees, or **Remove** to delete a search provider.

12. Click **Next** to go to the [Important URLs - Home Page and Support](important-urls-home-page-and-support-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Browser User Interface](browser-ui-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
