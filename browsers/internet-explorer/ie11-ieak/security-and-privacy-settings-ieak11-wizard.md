# Use the Security and Privacy Settings page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Security and Privacy Settings** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you manage your security zones, privacy settings, and content ratings. These settings help restrict the types of content your employees can access from the Internet, including any content that might be considered offensive or otherwise inappropriate in a corporate setting.

**To use the Security and Privacy Settings page**

1.  Decide if you want to customize your security zones and privacy settings. You can pick:

    -   **Do not customize security zones and privacy.** Pick this option if you don’t want to customize your security zones and privacy settings.

    -   **Import the current security zones and privacy.** Pick this option to import your security zone and privacy settings from your computer and use them as the preset for your employee’s settings.<p>**Note**<br>To change your settings, click **Modify Settings** to open the **Internet Properties** box, and then click the **Security** and **Privacy** tabs to make your changes.

2.  Decide if you want to customize your content ratings. You can pick:

    -   **Do not customize content ratings.** Pick this option if you don’t want to customize content ratings.

    -   **Import the current content ratings settings.** Pick this option to import your content rating settings from your computer and use them as the preset for your employee’s settings.<p>**Note**<br>Not all Internet content is rated. If you choose to allow users to view unrated sites, some of those sites could contain inappropriate material. To change your settings, click **Modify Settings** to open the **Content Advisor** box, where you can make your changes.
