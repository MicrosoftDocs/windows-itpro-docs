# Use the Automatic Version Synchronization page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Automatic Version Synchronization** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 runs the synchronization process every time you run the wizard, downloading the Internet Explorer 11 Setup file to your computer. The Setup file includes the required full and express packages.

**Important**<br>
You must run the **Automatic Version Synchronization** page once for each operating system and language combination of IE.

The **Automatic Version Synchronization** page tells you:

-   **Version available on your machine**. The version of IE11 that’s running on the computer that’s also running the IE Customization Wizard 11.

-   **Latest version available on web**. The most recently released version of the IE Customization Wizard 11. To get this value, the wizard compares the version of IE on your computer to the latest version of IE on the **Downloads** site. If the versions are different, you’ll be asked to update your version of IE.

-   **Disk space required**. The amount of space on your hard drive needed to update the browser.

-   **Disk space available**. The amount of hard drive space available on the computer that’s running the IE Customization Wizard 11.


**To use the Automatic Version Synchronization page**

1.  Click **Synchronize**.<p>
You might receive a security warning before downloading your Setup file, asking if you want to continue. Click **Run** to continue.

2.  Click **Next** to go to the [Custom Components](custom-components-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Feature Selection](feature-selection-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
