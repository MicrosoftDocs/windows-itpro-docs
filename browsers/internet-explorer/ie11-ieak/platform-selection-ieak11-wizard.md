#  Use the Platform Selection page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Platform Selection** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you pick the operating system and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) for the devices on which you’re going to install the custom installation package.

**To use the Platform Selection page**

1.  Pick the operating system and architecture for the devices on which you’re going to install the custom package.<p>
You must create individual packages for each supported operating system.<p>
**Note**<br>To keep your settings across several operating system packages, you can specify the same destination folder. Then, after running the wizard, you can reuse the resulting .ins file. Any additional changes to the .ins file are saved. For more info about using .ins files, see [Using Internet Settings (.INS) files with IEAK 11](using-internet-settings-ins-files.md). For more info about adding in your .ins file, see [Use the File Locations page in the IEAK 11 Wizard](file-locations-ieak11-wizard.md).

2.  Click **Next** to go to the [Language Selection](language-selection-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [File Locations](file-locations-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
