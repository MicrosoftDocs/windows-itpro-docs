### Corporations
IEAK helps corporate administrators establish version control, centrally distribute and manage browser installation, configure automatic connection profiles, and customize large portions of Internet Explorer, including features, security, communications settings, and other important functionality.

Corporate administrators install IEAK using Internal mode (for Internet Explorer 10 or newer) or Corporate mode (for Internet Explorer 9 or older).

### Internet service providers
IEAK helps ISPs customize, deploy and distribute, add third-party add-ons, search providers, and custom components, as well as include web slices and accelerators all as part of a custom Internet Explorer installation package.

ISPs install IEAK using External mode (for Internet Explorer 10 or newer) or Internet Service Provider (ISP) mode (for Internet Explorer 9 or older).

### Internet content providers
IEAK helps ICPs customize the appearance of Internet Explorer and its Setup program, including letting you add your company name or specific wording to the Title bar, set up a customer support webpage, set up the user home page and search providers, add links to the Favorites and the Explorer bars, add optional components, web slices and accelerators, and determine which compatibility mode Internet Explorer should use.

ICPs install IEAK using External mode (for Internet Explorer 10 or newer) or Internet Content Provider (ICP) mode (for Internet Explorer 9 or older)

### Independent software vendors
IEAK helps ISVs distribute (and redistribute) a custom version of Internet Explorer that can include custom components, programs, and controls (like the web browser control) that you create for your users. ISVs can also determine home pages, search providers, and add websites to the Favorites bar.

ISVs install IEAK using External mode (for Internet Explorer 10 or newer) or Internet Content Provider (ICP) mode (for Internet Explorer 9 or older).
