# Use the Compatibility View page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
We’re sorry. We’ve changed the way Compatibility View works in Internet Explorer 11 and have removed all of the functionality included on the **Compatibility View** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11. For more info about the changes we’ve made to the Compatibility View functionality, see [Missing the Compatibility View Button](../ie11-deploy-guide/missing-the-compatibility-view-button.md).

Click **Next** to go to the [Programs](programs-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Security and Privacy Settings](security-and-privacy-settings-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
