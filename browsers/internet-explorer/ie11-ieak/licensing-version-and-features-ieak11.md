# Determine the licensing version and features to use in IEAK 11
You must pick a version of IEAK 11 to run during installation, either **External** or **Internal**, based on your license agreement. Your version selection decides the options you can pick from, the steps you’ll have to follow to deploy your Internet Explorer 11 package, and how you’ll manage the browser after deployment.

-   **External Distribution as an Internet Service Provider (ISP), Internet Content Provider (ICP), or Developer.** If you’re an ISP or an ICP, your license agreement also says that you have to show the Internet Explorer logo on your packaging and promotional goods, as well as on your website.<p>
**Important**<br>Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that install IEAK 11 as part of a Windows product, under an OEM license agreement with Microsoft, must use their appropriate Windows OEM Preinstallation document (OPD) as the guide for allowable customizations.

-   **Internal Distribution via a Corporate Intranet.** This version is for network admins that plan to directly deploy IE11 into a corporate environment.
