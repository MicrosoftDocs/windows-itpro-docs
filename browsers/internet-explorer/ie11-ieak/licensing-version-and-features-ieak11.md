# Determine the licensing version and features to use in IEAK 11

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 workloads end of support for IE11](../includes/microsoft-365-ie-end-of-support.md)]

In addition to the Software License Terms for the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11, referred to as the "software"), these Guidelines further define how you may and may not use the software to create versions of Internet Explorer 11 with optional customizations (referred to as the "customized browser") for internal use and distribution in accordance with the IEAK 11 Software License Terms. IEAK 11 is for testing purposes only and is not intended to be used in a production environment.

During installation, you must pick a version of IEAK 11, either **External** or **Internal**, based on your license agreement. Your version selection decides the options you can chose, the steps you follow to deploy your Internet Explorer 11 package, and how you manage the browser after deployment.

-   **External Distribution as an Internet Service Provider (ISP), Internet Content Provider (ICP), or Developer.** If you are an ISP or an ICP, your license agreement also states that you must show the Internet Explorer logo on your packaging and promotional goods, as well as on your website.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that install IEAK 11 as part of a Windows product, under an OEM license agreement with Microsoft, must use their appropriate Windows OEM Preinstallation document (OPD) as the guide for allowable customizations.

-   **Internal Distribution via a Corporate Intranet.** This version is for network admins that plan to directly deploy IE11 into a corporate environment.

## Distribution guidelines

Two installation modes are available to you, depending on how you are planning to use the customized browser created with the software. Each mode requires a separate installation of the software.

-   **External Distribution**
    You shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the quality of (i) any non-Microsoft software distributed with Internet Explorer 11, and (ii) any media used for distribution (for example, optical media, flash drives), at a level that meets or exceeds the highest industry standards. If you distribute add-ons with Internet Explorer 11, those add-ons must comply with the [Microsoft browser extension policy](/legal/microsoft-edge/microsoft-browser-extension-policy).

-   **Internal Distribution - corporate intranet**
    The software is solely for use by your employees within your company's organization and affiliated companies through your corporate intranet. Neither you nor any of your employees may permit redistribution of the software to or for use by third parties other than for third parties such as consultants, contractors, and temporary staff accessing your corporate intranet.
