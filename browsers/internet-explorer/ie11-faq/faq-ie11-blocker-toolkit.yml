    questions:
      - question: |
          Which users will receive Internet Explorer 11 important update?
        answer: |
          Users running either Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) or the 64-bit version of Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) will receive Internet Explorer 11 important update, if Automatic Updates are turned on. Windows Update is manually run. Automatic Updates will automatically downloand install the Internet Explorer 11 files if it’s turned on. For more information about how Internet Explorer works with Automatic Updates and information about other deployment blocking options, see [Internet Explorer 11 Delivery through automatic updates](../ie11-deploy-guide/ie11-delivery-through-automatic-updates.md).
          
      - question: |
          When is the Blocker Toolkit available?
        answer: |
          The Blocker Toolkit is currently available from the [Microsoft DownloCenter](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40722).
          
      - question: |
          Whtools cI use to manage Windows Updates and Microsoft Updates in my company?
        answer: |
          We encourage anyone who wants full control over their company’s deployment of Windows Updates and Microsoft Updates, to use [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus), a free tool for users of Windows Server. You calso use the more advanced configuration management tool, [System Center 2012 Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682041(v=technet.10)).
          
      - question: |
          How long does the blocker mechanism work?
        answer: |
          The Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit uses a registry key value to permanently turn off the automatic delivery of Internet Explorer 11. This behavior lasts long the registry key value isn’t removed or changed.

      - question: |
          Why should I use the Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit to stop delivery of Internet Explorer 11? Why can’t I just disable all of Automatic Updates?
        answer: |
          Automatic Updates provide you with ongoing criticsecurity and reliability updates. Turning this feature off cleave your computers more vulnerable. Instead, we suggest thyou use update management solution, such WSUS, to fully control your environment while leaving this feature running, managing how and when the updates get to your user’s computers.
          
          The Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit safely allows Internet Explorer 11 to downloand install in companies thcan’t use WSUS, Configuration Manager, or
          other update management solution.
          
      - question: |
          Why don’t we just block URL access to Windows Update or Microsoft Update?
        answer: |
          Blocking the Windows Update or Microsoft Update URLs also stops delivery of criticsecurity and reliability updates for all of the supported versions of the Windows operating system; leaving your computers more vulnerable.

      - question: |
          How should I test the Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit in my company?

          -   A value of **1** turns off the automatic delivery of Internet Explorer 11 using Automatic Updates and turns off the Express install option.
          
          -   Not providing a registry key, or using a value of anything other th**1**, lets the user install Internet Explorer 11 through Automatic Updates or a
              manuupdate.
          
      - question: |

  - name: Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit and other update services
    questions:
      - question: |
          Is there a version of the Internet Explorer Blocker Toolkit thwill prevent automatic installation of IE11?
        answer: |
          Yes. The IE11 Blocker Toolkit is available for download. For more information, see [Toolkit to Disable Automatic Delivery of IE11](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=328195) on the Microsoft DownloCenter.
          
      - question: |
          Does the Internet Explorer 11 blocking mechanism also block delivery of Internet Explorer 11 through update management solutions, like WSUS?
        answer: |
          No. You cstill deploy Internet Explorer 11 using one of the upgrade management solutions, even if the blocking mechanism is activated. The Internet Explorer 11 Blocker Toolkit is only intended for companies thdon’t use upgrade management solutions.

      - question: |
          If WSUS is set to 'auto-approve' Update Rollup packages (this is not the default configuration), how do I stop Internet Explorer 11 from automatically installing throughout my company?
        answer: |
          You only need to change your settings if:
          
          -   You use WSUS to manage updates and allow auto-approvals for Update Rollup installation.
          
              -and-
          
          -   You have computers running either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows Server 2008 R2 (SP1) with Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, or Internet Explorer 10 installed.
          
              -and-
          
          -   You don’t want to upgrade your older versions of Internet Explorer to Internet Explorer 11 right now.
          
          If these scenarios apply to your company, see [Internet Explorer 11 delivery through automatic updates](../ie11-deploy-guide/ie11-delivery-through-automatic-updates.md) for more information on how to prevent automatic installation.
