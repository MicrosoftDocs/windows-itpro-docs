# Remove sites from a local compatibility view list

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

Remove websites that were added to a local compatibility view list by mistake or because they no longer have compatibility problems.

 **To remove sites from a local compatibility view list**

1.  Open Internet Explorer 11, click **Tools**, and then click **Compatibility View Settings**.

2.  Pick the site to remove, and then click **Remove**.<p>
Sites can only be removed one at a time. If one is removed by mistake, it can be added back using this same box and the **Add** section.
