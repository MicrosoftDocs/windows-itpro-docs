# Enterprise Mode for Microsoft Edge
Enterprise Mode, a compatibility mode that runs on Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 7 devices, lets websites render using a modified browser configuration that’s designed to emulate either Windows Internet Explorer 7 or Windows Internet Explorer 8. Running in this mode helps to avoid many of the common compatibility problems associated with web apps written and tested on older versions of Internet Explorer.

Many customers identify web app compatibility as a significant cost to upgrading because web apps need to be tested and upgraded before adopting a new browser. The improved compatibility provided by Enterprise Mode can help give customers the confidence to upgrade to IE11, letting customers benefit from modern web standards, increased performance, improved security, and better reliability.
