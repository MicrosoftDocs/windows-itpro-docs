# Adobe settings
>*Supported versions: Microsoft Edge on Windows 10*  

I need a description here, maybe with scenarios

## Allow Adobe Flash 
[!INCLUDE [allow-adobe-flash-include.md](includes/allow-adobe-flash-include.md)]


## Configure the Adobe Flash Click-to-Run setting
[!INCLUDE [configure-adobe-flash-click-to-run-include.md](includes/configure-adobe-flash-click-to-run-include.md)]
