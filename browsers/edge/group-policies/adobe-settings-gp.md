# Adobe Flash 

Adobe Flash Player still has a significant presence on the internet, such as digital ads. However, open standards, such as HTML5, provide many of the capabilities and functionalities becoming an alternative for content on the web. With Adobe no longer supporting Flash after 2020, Microsoft has started to phase out Flash from Microsoft Edge by adding the [Configure the Adobe Flash Click-to-Run setting](#configure-the-adobe-flash-click-to-run-setting) group policy giving you a way to control the list of websites that have permission to run Adobe Flash content.

To learn more about Microsoft’s plan for phasing out Flash from Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, see [The End of an Era — Next Steps for Adobe Flash]( https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/07/25/flash-on-windows-timeline/#3Bcc3QjRw0l7XsZ4.97) (blog article). 


You can find the Microsoft Edge Group Policy settings in the following location of the Group Policy Editor unless otherwise noted in the policy:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Microsoft Edge\\**

## Allow Adobe Flash 
[!INCLUDE [allow-adobe-flash-include.md](../includes/allow-adobe-flash-include.md)]


## Configure the Adobe Flash Click-to-Run setting
[!INCLUDE [configure-adobe-flash-click-to-run-include.md](../includes/configure-adobe-flash-click-to-run-include.md)]
