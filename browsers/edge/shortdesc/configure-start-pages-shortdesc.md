By default, Microsoft Edge loads the pages specified in App settings as the default Start pages.  With this policy, you can configure one or more Start pages when you enable this policy and enable the Configure Open Microsoft Edge With policy. Once you set the Start pages, either in this policy or Configure Open Microsoft Edge With policy, users cannot make changes.
