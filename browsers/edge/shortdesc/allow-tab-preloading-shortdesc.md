Microsoft Edge allows preloading of the Start and New Tab pages during Windows sign in, and each time Microsoft Edge closes by default. Preloading minimizes the amount of time required to start Microsoft Edge and load a new tab.  With this policy, you can configure Microsoft Edge to prevent preloading of tabs.
