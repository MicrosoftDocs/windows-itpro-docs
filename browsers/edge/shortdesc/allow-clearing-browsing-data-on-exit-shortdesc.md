Microsoft Edge does not clear the browsing data on exit by default, but users can configure the _Clear browsing data_ option in Settings.  Browsing data includes information you entered in forms, passwords, and even the websites visited. With this policy, you can configure Microsoft Edge to clear the browsing data automatically each time Microsoft Edge closes.
