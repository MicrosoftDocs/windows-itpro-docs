During browser navigation, Microsoft Edge checks the Microsoft Compatibility List for websites with known compatibility issues. If found, users are prompted to use Internet Explorer, where the site loads and displays correctly. Periodically during browser navigation, Microsoft Edge downloads the latest version of the list and applies the updates.  With this policy, you can configure Microsoft Edge to ignore the compatibility list.  You can view the compatibility list at about:compat.
