Configure how Microsoft Edge behaves when it’s running in kiosk mode with assigned access, either as a single-app or as one of many apps running on the kiosk device. You can control whether Microsoft Edge runs InPrivate full screen, InPrivate multi-tab with a tailored experience for kiosks, or normal browsing in Microsoft Edge.
