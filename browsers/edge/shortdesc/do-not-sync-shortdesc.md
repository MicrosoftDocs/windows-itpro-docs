By default, Microsoft Edge turns on the _Sync your settings_ toggle in **Settings > Device sync settings** letting users choose what to sync on their devices. Enabling this policy turns off and disables the _Sync your settings_ toggle preventing the syncing of user’s settings between their devices. If you want syncing turned off by default in Microsoft Edge but not disabled, enable this policy and select the _Allow users to turn syncing on_ option.
