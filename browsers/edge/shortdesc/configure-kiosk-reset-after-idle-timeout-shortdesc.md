You can configure Microsoft Edge kiosk mode to reset to the configured start experience after a specified amount of idle time in minutes (0-1440). The reset timer begins after the last user interaction. Once the idle time meets the time specified, a confirmation message prompts the user to continue, and if no user action, Microsoft Edge kiosk mode resets after 30 seconds. Resetting to the configured start experience deletes the current user’s browsing data.
