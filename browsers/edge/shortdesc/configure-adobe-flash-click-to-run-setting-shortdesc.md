Microsoft Edge supports Adobe Flash as a built-in feature rather than as an external add-on and updates automatically via Windows Update. By default, Microsoft Edge prevents Adobe Flash content from loading automatically, requiring action from the user, for example, clicking the **Click-to-Run** button.  Depending on how often the content loads and runs, the sites for the content gets added to the auto-allowed list. Disable this policy if you want Adobe Flash content to load automatically.
