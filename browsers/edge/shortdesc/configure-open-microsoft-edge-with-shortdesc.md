By default, Microsoft Edge loads a specific page or pages defined in the Configure Start Pages policy and allow users to make changes. With this policy, you can configure Microsoft Edge to load either the Start page, New Tab page, previously opened pages. You can also configure Microsoft Edge to prevent users from changing or customizing the Start page. For this policy to work correctly, you must also configure the Configure Start Pages. If you want to prevent users from making changes, don’t configure the Disable Lockdown of Start Pages policy.
