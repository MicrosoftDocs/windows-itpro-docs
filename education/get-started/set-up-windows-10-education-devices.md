We recommend using the latest build of Windows 10, version 1703 on your education devices. 

To set up new Windows 10 devices and enroll them to your education tenant, choose from one of these options and follow the link to watch the video or follow the step-by-step guide:
- **Option 1: [Use the Set up School PCs app](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/windows/use-set-up-school-pcs-app)** - You can use the app to create a setup file that you can use to quickly set up one or more Windows 10 devices.
- **Option 2: [Go through Windows OOBE and join the device to Azure AD](set-up-windows-education-devices.md)** - You can go through a typical Windows 10 device setup or first-run experience to configure your device.
