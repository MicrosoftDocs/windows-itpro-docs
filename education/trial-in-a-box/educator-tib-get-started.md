## <a name="edu-task1"></a>1. Log in and connect to the school network
To try out the educator tasks, start by logging in as a teacher.

1. Turn on **Device A** and ensure you plug in the PC to an electrical outlet.
2. Connect **Device A** to your school's Wi-Fi network or connect with a local Ethernet connection using the Ethernet adapter included in this kit.
   >**Note**: If your Wi-Fi network requires a web browser login page to connect to the Internet, connect using the Ethernet port. If your Wi-Fi network has additional restrictions that will prevent the device from connecting to the internet without registration, consider connecting **Device A** to a different network.

3. Log in to **Device A** using the **Teacher Username** and **Teacher Password** included in the **Credentials Sheet** located in your kit.

The **Math Assistant** and **Ink Replay** features available in the OneNote app give your students step-by-step instructions on how to solve their math problems and help them visualize math functions on an interactive 2D graph.

**Let's solve 3x+4=7 in OneNote using the pen!**
To get started:
1. Open the OneNote app for Windows 10 (not OneNote 2016).

   ![OneNote icon](images/OneNote_logo.png)

2. In the top left corner, click on the **<** arrow to access your notebooks and pages.

   ![OneNote back arrow navigation button](images/left_arrow.png)

3. Click **Add Page** to launch a blank work space.

   ![Select add page button](images/plus-page.png)

4. Make sure your pen is paired to the device. To pair, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12383" target="_blank">Connect to Bluetooth devices</a>.

To solve the equation 3x+4=7, follow these instructions:
1. Write the equation 3x+4=7 in ink using the pen or type it in as text.

2. If you wrote the equation using digital ink, use the **Lasso tool** to circle the equation. If you typed the equation, highlight it using your mouse.

   ![Lasso button](images/lasso.png)

3. On the **Draw** tab, click the **Math** button.

   ![Math button](images/math-button.png)

4. From the drop-down menu in the **Math** pane, select the option to **Solve for x**. You can now see the final solution of the equation.

   ![Solve for x menu](images/solve-for-x.png)

5. From the second drop-down below, choose **Steps for Solving Linear Formula**, which shows you the step-by-step solution of this equation.

6. On the **View** tab, click the **Replay** button. Use your mouse to select the written equation and watch your text in replay. Replay is great for students to review how the teacher solved the equation and for teachers to review how students approached a problem.

   ![Replay button](images/replay.png)

To graph the equation 3x+4=7, follow these instructions:
1. From the drop-down menu in the **Math** pane, select the option to **Graph Both Sides in 2D**. You can play with the interactive graph of your equation - use a single finger to move the graph position or two fingers to change the **zoom** level.

   ![Graph both sides in 2D](images/graph-for-x.png)

2. Click the **Insert on Page** button below the graph to add a screenshot of the graph to your page.
