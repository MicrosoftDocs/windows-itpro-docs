# Provision student PCs with apps

To create and apply a provisioning package that contains apps to a device running all desktop editions of Windows 10 except Windows 10 Home, follow the steps in [Provision PCs with apps](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provision-pcs-with-apps).

Provisioning packages can include management instructions and policies, installation of specific apps, customization of network connections and policies, and more.

You can apply a provisioning package on a USB drive to off-the-shelf devices during setup, making it fast and easy to configure new devices.

- If you want to provision a school PC to join Azure AD, set up the PC using the steps in [Use Set up School PCs App](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md).
