# Windows 10 editions for education customers

Windows 10, version 1607 (Anniversary Update) continues our commitment to productivity, security, and privacy for all customers. Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Enterprise offer the functionality and safety features demanded by business and education customers around the globe. Windows 10 is the most secure Windows we’ve ever built. All of our Windows commercial editions can be configured to support the needs of schools, through group policies, domain join, and more. To learn more about Microsoft’s commitment to security and privacy in Windows 10, see more on both [security](/windows/security/security-foundations) and [privacy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=822620).

Beginning with version 1607, Windows 10 offers various new features and functionality, such as simplified provisioning with the [Set up School PCs app](./use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md) or [Windows Configuration Designer](./set-up-students-pcs-to-join-domain.md), easier delivery of digital assessments with [Take a Test](./take-tests-in-windows.md), and faster sign-in performance for shared devices than ever before. These features work with all Windows for desktop editions, excluding Windows 10 Home. You can find more information on [windows.com](https://www.windows.com/).

Windows 10, version 1607 introduces two editions designed for the unique needs of K-12 institutions: [Windows 10 Pro Education](#windows-10-pro-education) and [Windows 10 Education](#windows-10-education). These editions provide education-specific default settings for the evolving landscape in K-12 education IT environments.

## Windows 10 Pro Education

Windows 10 Pro Education builds on the commercial version of Windows 10 Pro and provides important management controls needed in schools. Windows 10 Pro Education is effectively a variant of Windows 10 Pro that provides education-specific default settings. These default settings disable tips, tricks and suggestions & Microsoft Store suggestions. More detailed information on these default settings is available in [Manage Windows 10 and Microsoft Store tips, tricks, and suggestions](/windows/configuration/manage-tips-and-suggestions).

For Cortana<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>:
- If you're using version 1607, Cortana is removed.
- If you're using new devices with version 1703 or later, Cortana is turned on by default.
- If you're upgrading from version 1607 to version 1703 or later, Cortana will be enabled.

You can use the **AllowCortana** policy to turn off Cortana. For more information, see [Windows 10 configuration recommendations for education customers](configure-windows-for-education.md).

Windows 10 Pro Education is available on new devices pre-installed with Windows 10, version 1607 or newer versions that are purchased with discounted K-12 academic licenses through OEM partners (these discounted licenses are sometimes referred to as National Academic or Shape the Future).

Existing devices running Windows 10 Pro, currently activated with the original OEM digital product key and purchased with discounted K-12 academic licenses through OEM partners (these discounted licenses are sometimes referred to as National Academic or Shape the Future), will upgrade automatically to Windows 10 Pro Education as part of the Windows 10, version 1607 installation.

Customers with Academic Volume Licensing agreements with rights for Windows can get Windows 10 Pro Education through the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

Customers who deploy Windows 10 Pro are able to configure the product to have similar feature settings to Windows 10 Pro Education using policies. More detailed information on these policies and the configuration steps required is available in [Manage Windows 10 and Microsoft Store tips, tricks, and suggestions](/windows/configuration/manage-tips-and-suggestions). We recommend that K-12 customers using commercial Windows 10 Pro read the [document](/windows/configuration/manage-tips-and-suggestions) and apply desired settings for your environment.

## Windows 10 Education

Windows 10 Education builds on Windows 10 Enterprise and provides the enterprise-grade manageability and security desired by many schools. Windows 10 Education is effectively a variant of Windows 10 Enterprise that provides education-specific default settings. These default settings disable tips, tricks and suggestions & Microsoft Store suggestions. More detailed information on these default settings is available in [Manage Windows 10 and Microsoft Store tips, tricks, and suggestions](/windows/configuration/manage-tips-and-suggestions).

For Cortana<sup>1</sup>:
- If you're using version 1607, Cortana<sup>1</sup> is removed.
- If you're using new devices with version 1703 or later, Cortana is turned on by default.
- If you're upgrading from version 1607 to version 1703 or later, Cortana will be enabled.

You can use the **AllowCortana** policy to turn off Cortana. For more information, see [Windows 10 configuration recommendations for education customers](configure-windows-for-education.md).

Windows 10 Education is available through Microsoft Volume Licensing. Customers who are already running Windows 10 Education can upgrade to Windows 10, version 1607 or newer versions through Windows Update or from the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). We recommend Windows 10 Education to all K-12 customers as it provides the most complete and secure edition for education environments. If you don't have access to Windows 10 Education, contact your Microsoft representative or see more information [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=822628).

Customers who deploy Windows 10 Enterprise are able to configure the product to have similar feature settings to Windows 10 Education using policies. More detailed information on these policies and the configuration steps required is available in [Manage Windows 10 and Microsoft Store tips, tricks, and suggestions](/windows/configuration/manage-tips-and-suggestions). We recommend that K-12 customers using commercial Windows 10 Enterprise read the [document](/windows/configuration/manage-tips-and-suggestions) and apply desired settings for your environment.
