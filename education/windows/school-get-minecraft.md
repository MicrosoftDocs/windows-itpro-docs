# For IT administrators: get Minecraft Education Edition

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10  

When you sign up for early access to [Minecraft Education Edition](http://education.minecraft.net), Minecraft will be added to the inventory in your Windows Store for Business, a private version of Windows Store associated with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Your Store for Business is only displayed to members of your organization.

> **Note**: If you don't have an Azure AD or Office 365 tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 subscription when you request Minecraft Education Edition.

## Add Minecraft to your Windows Store for Business 

You can start with the Minecraft: Education Edition trial to get individual copies of the app. For more information, see [Minecraft: Education Edition - individual copies](#individual-copies). 

If you’ve been approved and are part of the Enrollment for Education Solutions program, you can purchase a volume license for Minecraft: Education Edition. For more information, see [Minecraft: Education Edition - volume license](#volume-license)

## Manage Minecraft Education Edition

### Access to Windows Store for Business
By default, when a teacher with a work or school account in your edu tenant acquires Minecraft: Education Edition, they are automatically signed up for Window Store for Business, and the **Basic Purchaser** role is assigned to them. **Basic Purchaser** role allows teachers to acquire Minecraft: Education Edition and to distribute it to students. 

However, tenant admins can control whether or not teachers automatically sign up for Windows Store for Business, and get the **Basic Purachaser** role. You can configure this with the **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Windows Store for Business.** You'll find this on the **Permissions** page. 

To prevent educators from automatically signing up for Windows Store for Business
1.  In Windows Store for Business, click **Settings**, and then click **Permissions**.

- View the Minecraft product description page 
- Acquire and manage the app
- Info on Support page (including links to documentation and access to support through customer service)

## <a href="" id="private-store"></a>Private store

When you create you Windows Store for Business account, you'll have a set of apps included for free in your private store. Apps in your private store are available for all people in your organization to install and use. 

These apps will automatically be in your private store:
- Word mobile
- Excel mobile
- PowerPoint mobile
- OneNote
- Sway
- Fresh Paint
- Minecraft: Education Edition

As an admin, you can remove any of these apps from the private store if you'd prefer to control how apps are distributed.  

## Need more copies of Minecraft: Education Edition?
You can purchase more licenses by working with your channel partner. Licenses are available at a lower rate than the price for individual copies that are available through Windows Store for Business. Individual copies are also available through Windows Store for Business. 

If you’ve purchased a volume license, be sure to let other basic purchasers in your organization know about the volume license. That should help prevent unnecessary purchases of individual copies.
