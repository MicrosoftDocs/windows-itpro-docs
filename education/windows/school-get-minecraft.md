# For IT administrators - get Minecraft: Education Edition

When you sign up for a [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net) trial, or purchase a [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net) subscription, Minecraft: Education Edition will be added to the inventory in your Microsoft Admin Center which is associated with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Your Microsoft Admin Center is only displayed to members of your organization with administrative roles.

>[!Note]
>If you don't have an Azure AD or Office 365 tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 Education subscription when you purchase Minecraft: Education Edition. For more information, see [Office 365 Education plans and pricing](https://products.office.com/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans).

## Settings for Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5 customers

Schools that purchased Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5 have an extra option for making Minecraft: Education Edition available to their students:

If your school has these products in your tenant, admins can choose to enable Minecraft: Education Edition for students using Microsoft 365 A3 or Microsoft 365 A5. From the left-hand menu in Microsoft Admin Center, select Users. From the Users list, select the users you want to add or remove for Minecraft: Education Edition access. Add the relevant A3 or A5 license if it hasn't been assigned already. 

> [!Note]
> If you add a faculty license, the user will be assigned an instructor role in the application and will have elevated permissions.

After selecting the appropriate product license, ensure Minecraft: Education Edition is toggled on or off, depending on if you want to add or remove Minecraft: Education Edition from the user (it will be on by default).

If you turn off this setting after students have been using Minecraft: Education Edition, they will have up to 30 more days to use Minecraft: Education Edition before they don't have access.
