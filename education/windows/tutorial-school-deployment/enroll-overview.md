# Device enrollment overview

There are three main methods for joining Windows devices to Azure AD and getting them enrolled and managed by Intune:

- **Automatic Intune enrollment via Azure AD join** happens when a user first turns on a device that is in out-of-box experience (OOBE), and selects the option to join Azure AD. In this scenario, the user can customize certain Windows functionalities before reaching the desktop, and becomes a local administrator of the device. This option isn't an ideal enrollment method for education devices
- **Bulk enrollment with provisioning packages.** Provisioning packages are files that can be used to set up Windows devices, and can include information to connect to Wi-Fi networks and to join an Azure AD tenant. Provisioning packages can be created using either **Set Up School PCs** or **Windows Configuration Designer** applications. These files can be applied during or after the out-of-box experience
- **Enrollment via Windows Autopilot.** Windows Autopilot is a collection of cloud services to configure the out-of-box experience, enabling light-touch or zero-touch deployment scenarios. Windows Autopilot simplifies the Windows device lifecycle, from initial deployment to end of life, for OEMs, resellers, IT administrators and end users

## Choose the enrollment method

**Windows Autopilot** and the **Set up School PCs** app are usually the most efficient options for school environments.
This [table][INT-1] describes the ideal scenarios for using either option. It's recommended to review the table when planning your enrollment and deployment strategies.
