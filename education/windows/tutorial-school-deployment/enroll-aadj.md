# Automatic Intune enrollment via Azure AD join

If you're setting up a Windows device individually, you can use the out-of-box experience to join it to your school's Azure Active Directory tenant, and automatically enroll it in Intune.
With this process, no advance preparation is needed:

1. Follow the on-screen prompts for region selection, keyboard selection, and network connection
1. Wait for updates. If any updates are available, they'll be installed at this time

1. When prompted, select **Set up for work or school** and authenticate using your school's Azure Active Directory account

1. The device will join Azure AD and automatically enroll in Intune. All settings defined in Intune will be applied to the device

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configured enrollment restrictions in Intune blocking personal Windows devices, this process will not complete. You will need to use a different enrollment method, or ensure that the devices are registered in Autopilot.
