# What is Set up School PCs?

The **Set up School PCs** app helps you configure new Windows 10 PCs for school use. The app, which is available for Windows 10 version 1703 and later, configures and saves school-optimized settings, apps, and policies into a single provisioning package. You can then save the package to a USB drive and distribute it to your school PCs.

If your school uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Office 365, the Set up
School PCs app will create a setup file. This file joins the PC to your Azure Active Directory tenant. The app also helps set up PCs for use with or without Internet connectivity.
