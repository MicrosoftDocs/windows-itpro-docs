# Test Windows 10 in S mode on existing Windows 10 education devices

The Windows 10 in S mode self-installer will allow you to test Windows 10 in S mode on various individual Windows 10 devices (except Windows 10 Home) with a genuine, activated license<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. Test Windows 10 in S mode on various devices in your school and share your feedback with us.

Windows 10 in S mode is built to give schools the familiar, robust, and productive experiences you count on from Windows in an experience that's been streamlined for security and performance in the classroom, and built to work with Microsoft Education<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

Windows 10 in S mode is different from other editions of Windows 10 as everything that runs on the device is verified by Microsoft for security and performance. Therefore, Windows 10 in S mode works exclusively with apps from the Microsoft Store. Some accessories and apps compatible with Windows 10 may not work and performance may vary. Certain default settings, features, and apps can't be changed. When you install Windows 10 in S mode, your existing applications and settings will be deleted, and you'll only be able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.

**Configuring Windows 10 in S mode for school use is easy:** Education customers must configure **SetEduPolicies** for use in K-12 schools. For more information on how to do these configurations, see [Use the Set up School PCs app](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md) and [Windows 10 configuration recommendations for education customers](configure-windows-for-education.md).

**Installing Office 365 for Windows 10 in S mode (Education preview)**: To install the Office applications in a school environment, you must use the free Setup School PCs app, which is available on the Microsoft Store for Education and from the Microsoft Store.

As we finalize development of Office 365 for Windows 10 in S mode (Education preview), the applications will be updated automatically. You must have an Office license to activate the applications once they're installed. For more information about Office 365 for Education plans, see [Office on Windows 10 in S mode](https://support.microsoft.com/office/office-on-windows-10-in-s-mode-717193b5-ff9f-4388-84c0-277ddf07fe3f?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

## Before you install Windows 10 in S mode

### Important information

Before you install Windows 10 in S mode, understand that non-Microsoft Store apps won't work, peripherals that require custom drivers may not work, and other errors may occur. In particular, this release of Windows 10 in S mode:

- Is intended for education customers to test compatibility with existing hardware
- May not work with some device drivers, which may not yet be ready for Windows 10 in S mode and may cause some loss in functionality
- May not be compatible with all peripherals that require custom drivers and, even if compatible, may cause aspects of the peripheral to not function
- Has software and feature limitations compared to other Windows 10 editions, primarily that Windows 10 in S mode is limited to Store apps only

    > [!WARNING]
    > You can install Windows 10 in S mode on devices running other editions of Windows 10. For more information, see [Supported devices](#supported-devices). However, we don't recommend installing Windows 10 in S mode on Windows 10 Home devices as you won't be able to activate it.

- Won't run current Win32 software and might result in the loss of any data associated with that software, which might include software already purchased

Due to these reasons, we recommend that you use the installation tool and avoid doing a clean install from an ISO media.

Before you install Windows 10 in S mode on your existing Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro Education, Windows 10 Education, or Windows 10 Enterprise device:

- Make sure that you updated your existing device to Windows 10, version 1703.

    To update your device to Windows 10, version 1703, see [Download Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10). You can verify your current version in **Settings > System > About**.

- Install the latest Windows Update.

    To do this task, go to **Settings > Update & security > Windows Update**.

- Create a system backup in case you would like to return to your previously installed version of Windows 10 after trying Windows 10 in S mode.

  For more information on how to create the system backup, see [Create a recovery drive](#create-a-recovery-drive).

## Supported devices

The Windows 10 in S mode install will install and activate on the following editions of Windows 10 in use by schools:

- Windows 10 Pro
- Windows 10 Pro Education
- Windows 10 Education
- Windows 10 Enterprise

Other Windows 10 editions can't be activated and aren't supported. If your device isn't running one of these supported Windows 10 editions, don't proceed with using the Windows 10 in S mode installer. Windows 10-N editions and running in virtual machines aren't supported by the Windows 10 in S mode installer.

### Preparing your device to install drivers

Make sure all drivers are installed and working properly on your device running Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro Education, Windows 10 Education, or Windows 10 Enterprise before installing Windows 10 in S mode.

### Supported devices and drivers

Check with your device manufacturer before trying Windows 10 in S mode on your device to see if the drivers are available and supported by the device manufacturer.

## Kept files

Back up all your data before installing Windows 10 in S mode. Only personal files may be kept during installation. Your settings and apps will be deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> All existing Win32 applications and data will be deleted. Save any data or installation files in case you may need to access that data again or need to reinstall these applications later.

## Domain join

Windows 10 in S mode doesn't support non-Azure Active Directory domain accounts. Before installing Windows 10 in S mode, you must have at least one of these administrator accounts:

- Local administrator
- Microsoft account administrator
- Azure Active Directory administrator

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't have one of these administrator accounts accessible before migration, you'll not be able to sign in to your device after migrating to Windows 10 in S mode.

We recommend [creating a recovery drive](#create-a-recovery-drive) before migrating to Windows 10 in S mode in case you run into this issue.

## Installing Office applications

After installing Windows 10 in S mode, use the free [Set up School PCs app](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md) to install Office 365 for Windows 10 in S mode (Education preview). You must have an Office license to activate the applications once they're installed.

## Switch to previously installed Windows 10 editions

If Windows 10 in S mode isn't right for you, you can switch to the Windows 10 edition previously installed on your device(s).

- Education customers can switch devices to Windows 10 Pro Education using the Microsoft Store for Education. For more information, see [Switch to Windows 10 Pro Education from Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 in S mode](change-to-pro-education.md).
- If you try Windows 10 in S mode and decide to switch back to the previously installed edition within 10 days, you can go back to the previously installed edition using the Windows Recovery option in Settings. For more info, see [Go back to your previous edition of Windows 10](#go-back-to-your-previous-edition-of-windows-10).

## Device recovery

Before installing Windows 10 in S mode, we recommend that you create a system backup in case you would like to return to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Pro Education after trying Windows 10 in S mode.

### Create a recovery drive

To create a recovery drive, follow these steps.

1. From the taskbar, search for **Create a recovery drive** and then select it. You might be asked to enter an admin password or confirm your choice.
2. In the **Recovery drive** tool, make sure **Back up system files to the recovery drive** is selected and then select **Next**.
3. Connect a USB drive to your PC, select it, and then select **Next > Create**.

    Many files need to be copied to the recovery drive; so this process might take a while.

4. When it's done, you might see a **Delete the recovery partition from your PC** link on the final screen. If you want to free up drive space on your PC, select the link, and then select **Delete**. If not, select **Finish**.

### Go back to your previous edition of Windows 10

Alternatively, for 10 days after you install Windows 10 in S mode, you can go back to your previous edition of Windows 10 from **Settings > Update & security > Recovery**. This revert operation will keep your personal files, but it will remove installed apps and any changes you made to **Settings**.

To go back, you need to:

- Keep everything in the `windows.old` and `$windows.~bt` folders after the upgrade.
- Remove any user accounts you added after the upgrade.

If going back isn't available:

- Check if you can restore your PC to factory settings. This restoration will reinstall the version of Windows that came with your PC and remove personal files, apps, and drivers you installed and any changes you made to **Settings**. Go to **Settings > Update & security > Recovery > Reset this PC > Get started** and look for **Restore factory settings**.
- If you've a product key for your previous version of Windows, use the media creation tool. It can create installation media of your previous Windows 10 edition, and do a clean install.

After going back to your previous edition of Windows 10, you may receive the following message when launching Win32 apps:

> For security and performance, this mode of Windows only runs verified apps from the Store.

If you see this message, follow these steps to stop receiving the message:

1. If you've BitLocker enabled, disable it first in the Control Panel. Go to **Manage BitLocker** and select **Turn off BitLocker**.
2. Open Windows **Settings** and go to **Update & security > Recovery**.
3. In the **Recovery** page, find **Advanced startup** and select **Restart now** to start your PC.
4. After restarting, in the **Choose an option** page, select **Troubleshoot**.
5. In the **Troubleshoot** page, select **Advanced options**, and in the **Advanced options** page select **UEFI Firmware Settings**.
6. In the **UEFI Firmware Settings** page, select **Restart** to get to the device-specific UEFI/BIOS menu.
7. Once you've accessed UEFI, look for the menu item labeled **Security** or **Security Settings**, and navigate to it.
8. Look for an option called **Secure boot configuration**, **Secure boot**, or **UEFI Boot**. If you can't find one of these options, check the **Boot** menu.
9. Disable the secure boot/UEFI boot option.
10. Save your settings and then exit UEFI. This exit action will restart your PC.
11. After Windows is done booting up, confirm that you no longer see the message.

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend following these steps again to re-enable the **Secure boot configuration**, **Secure boot**, or **UEFI Boot** option, which you disabled in step 9, and then subsequently re-enable BitLocker (if you previously had this enabled).
