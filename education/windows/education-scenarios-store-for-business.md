# Working with Microsoft Store for Education

Learn about education scenarios for Microsoft Store for Education. IT admins and teachers can use Microsoft Store to find, acquire, distribute, and manage apps.

Many of the [settings in Microsoft Store for Business](/microsoft-store/settings-reference-microsoft-store-for-business) also apply in Microsoft Store for Education. Several of the items in this topic are unique to Microsoft Store for Education.  

## Basic Purchaser role
Applies to: IT admins

By default, when a teacher with a work or school account signs up for Microsoft Store for Education, the **Basic Purchaser** role is assigned to them. **Basic Purchaser** role allows teachers to: 
- View the Minecraft: Education Edition product description page 
- Acquire and manage Minecraft: Education Edition, and other apps from Store for Education
- Use info on **Support** (including links to documentation and access to support through customer service)

> [!NOTE]
> People with the **Basic Purchaser** role can only manage (assign and reclaim licenses) for apps that they purchased. They can't manage apps purchased by people with **Purchaser** or **Admin** roles. 

Admins can control whether or not teachers are automatically assigned the **Basic Purchaser** role. You can configure this with **Make everyone a Basic Purchaser**. You'll find this on **Settings**, with **Shop** settings. 

**To manage Make everyone a Basic Purchaser**
1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com)
2. Click **Manage**, and then click **Settings**. 
3. On **Shop**, select or clear **Make everyone a Basic Purchaser**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Make everyone a Basic Purchaser** is on by default. 

When **Make everyone a Basic Purchaser** is turned off, admins can manually assign the role to teachers. 

**To assign Basic Purchaser role**

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com)
2. Click **Manage**, and then choose **Permissions**.
3. On **Roles**, click **Assign roles**, type and select a name, choose the role you want to assign, and then click **Save**.


**Blocked Basic Purchasers**

When **Make everyone a Basic Purchaser** is on, admins can still manage which users have the **Basic Purchaser** role. An admin can unassign the **Basic Purchaser** role from a user, and the user is added to a list of **Blocked Basic Purchasers**. Admins can review who are **Basic Purchasers** and **Blocked Basic Purchasers** on **Permissions**. 

## Private store

Applies to: IT admins

When you create your Microsoft Store for Education account, you'll have a set of apps included for free in your private store. Apps in your private store are available for all people in your organization to install and use. 

These apps will automatically be in your private store:
- Word mobile
- Excel mobile
- PowerPoint mobile
- OneNote
- Sway
- Fresh Paint
- Minecraft: Education Edition

As an admin, you can remove any of these apps from the private store if you'd prefer to control how apps are distributed.

## Manage domain settings 

Applies to: IT admins

### Self-service sign up
Self-service sign-up makes it easier for users in your organization to sign up for online services from Microsoft. We call this sign up process "self-service sign-up" because your users can sign up to use services paid by your subscription, or use free services, without asking you to take action on their behalf. For more information on self-service sign up, see [Using self-service sign up in your organization](https://support.office.com/article/Using-self-service-sign-up-in-your-organization-4f8712ff-9346-4c6c-bb63-a21ad7a62cbd?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

### Domain verification
For education organizations, domain verification ensures you are on the academic verification list. As an admin, you might need to verify your domain using the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Verify your Office 365 domain to prove ownership, nonprofit or education status](https://support.office.com/article/Verify-your-Office-365-domain-to-prove-ownership-nonprofit-or-education-status-or-to-activate-Yammer-87d1844e-aa47-4dc0-a61b-1b773fd4e590?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).
