Learn about education scenarios for Windows Store for Business. IT admins and teachers can use Windows Store for Business to find, acquire, distribute, and manage apps. 

## Manage Windows Store for Business settings

### Access to Windows Store for Business
Applies to: IT admins

By default, when a teacher with a work or school account acquires Minecraft: Education Edition,they are automatically signed up for Window Store for Business, and the **Basic Purchaser** role is assigned to them. **Basic Purchaser** role allows teachers to acquire Minecraft: Education Edition and to distribute it to students. 

However, tenant admins can control whether or not teachers automatically sign up for Windows Store for Business, and get the **Basic Purchaser** role. You can configure this with **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Windows Store for Business.** You'll find this on the **Permissions** page. 

**To manage educator access to Windows Store for Business**
1.  In Windows Store for Business, click **Settings**, and then click **Permissions**.
