To learn more and get started, go to https://education.minecraft.net/ and select **GET STARTED**.

## Purchase Minecraft: Education Edition for Teachers and Students

Minecraft: Education Edition is licensed via yearly subscriptions that are purchased through the Microsoft Store for Education, via volume licensing agreements and through partner resellers. 

>[!Note]
>M:EE is available on many platforms, but all license purchases can only be done through one of the three methods listed above.

As a teacher, you may purchase subscription licenses for you and your students directly through the Microsoft Store for Education, or you may already have access to licenses at your school (through a volume license agreement) if you have an Office 365 account. 

>[!Note] 
>If you already have Office 365, you may already have Minecraft: Education Edition licenses for your school! M:EE is included in many volume license agreements, however, only the administrators at your school will be able to assign and manage those licenses. If you have an Office 365 account, check with your school administration or IT administrator prior to purchasing M:EE directly.

You can purchase individual Minecraft: Education Edition subscriptions for you and other teachers and students directly in the Microsoft Store for Education.

To purchase individual Minecraft: Education Edition subscriptions (i.e. direct purchase):

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com/) with your Office 365 account.
2. Click on [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://educationstore.microsoft.com/en-us/store/details/minecraft-education-edition/9nblggh4r2r6) (or use Search the Store to find it)
3. Click **Buy**

>[!Note]
>Administrators can restrict the ability for teachers to purchase applications in the Microsoft Store for Education. If you do not have the ability to Buy, contact your school administration or IT administrator.

    
## Distribute Minecraft

- You can install the app on your PC.
- You can assign the app to others.  
- You can download the app to distribute.

   You can assign the app to students with work or school accounts. </br>
   If you don't find the student, you can still assign the app to them if self-service sign up is supported for your domain. Students will receive an email with a link to Office 365 portal where they can create an account, and then install **Minecraft: Education Edition**. Questions about self-service sign up? Check with your admin.

### Download for others
Download for others allows teachers or IT admins to download a packages that they can install on student PCs. This will install Minecraft: Education Edition on the PC, and allows anyone with a Windows account to use the app on that PC. This option is best for students, and for shared computers. Choose this option when:
- You have administrative permissions to install apps on the PC. 
- You want to install this app on each of your student's Windows 10 (at least version 1511) PCs. 
- Your students share Windows 10 computers, but sign in with their own Windows account. 

#### Requirements
- Administrative permissions are required on the PC. If you don't have the correct permissions, you won't be able to install the app. 
- Windows 10 (at least version 1511) is required for PCs running Minecraft: Education Edition.

#### Check for updates
Minecraft: Education Edition will not install if there are updates pending for other apps on the PC. Before installing Minecraft, check to see if there are pending updates for Microsoft Store apps. 

**To check for app updates**
1. Start Microsoft Store app on the PC (click **Start**, and type **Store**).
2. Click the account button, and then click **Downloads and updates**.

#### To download for others
You'll download a .zip file, extract the files, and then use one of the files to install Minecraft: Education Edition on each PC. 

1. **Download Minecraft Education Edition.zip**. From the **Minecraft: Education Edition** page, click **Download for others** tab, and then click **Download**.

    ![Microsoft Store app showing access to My Library](images/mc-dnld-others-teacher.png)
 
2. **Extract files**. Find the .zip file that you downloaded and extract the files. This is usually your **Downloads** folder, unless you chose to save the .zip file to a different location. Right-click the file and choose **Extract all**.
3. **Save to USB drive**. After you've extracted the files, save the Minecraft: Education Edition folder to a USB drive, or to a network location that you can access from each PC.  
4. **Install app**. Use the USB drive to copy the Minecraft folder to each Windows 10 PC where you want to install Minecraft: Education Edition. Open Minecraft: Education Edition folder, right-click **InstallMinecraftEducationEdition.bat** and click **Run as administrator**. 
5. **Quick check**. The install program checks the PC to make sure it can run Minecraft: Education Edition. If your PC passes this test, the app will automatically install.
6. **Restart**. Once installation is complete, restart each PC. Minecraft: Education Edition app is now ready for any student to use.
