### Enabled apps

| App type | Enabled |
| --- | --- |
| Apps that run in a browser | ✔️ Apps that run in a browser, like Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Web apps, can run on Windows 11 SE without any changes or limitations. |
| Apps that require installation | ❌ Apps that require an installation, including Microsoft Store apps and Win32 apps can't be installed. If students try to install these apps, the installation fails. <br/><br/>✔️ If there are specific installation-type of apps you want to enable, then work with Microsoft to get them enabled. For more information, see [Add your own apps](#add-your-own-apps) (in this article). |

### Add your own apps

If the apps you need aren't shown in the [available apps list](#available-apps) (in this article), then you can submit an application request at [aka.ms/eduapprequest](https://aka.ms/eduapprequest). Anyone from a school district can submit the request. In the form, sign in with your school account, such as `user@contoso.edu`. We'll update you using this email account.

Microsoft reviews every app request to make sure each app meets the following requirements:

- Apps can be any native Windows app type, such as a Microsoft Store app, Win32 app, `.MSIX`, `.APPX`, and more.

- Apps must be in one of the following app categories:​
  - Content Filtering apps​
  - Test Taking solutions​
  - Assistive technologies
  - Classroom communication apps​
  - Essential diagnostics, management, and supportability apps

- Apps must meet the performance [requirements of Windows 11](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements).

- Apps must meet the following security requirements:
  - All app binaries are code-signed​.
  - All files include the `OriginalFileName` in the resource file header​.
  - All kernel drivers are WHQL-signed.

- Apps don't have an equivalent web application​.

- Apps can't invoke any processes that can be used to jailbreak a device, automate jailbreaks, or present a security risk. For example, processes such as Reg.exe, CBE.exe, CMD.exe, and KD.exe are blocked on Windows 11 SE.

If the app meets the requirements, Microsoft works with the Independent Software Vendor (ISV) to test the app, and make sure the app works as expected on Windows 11 SE.

When the app is ready, Microsoft will update you. Then, you add the app to the [Intune for Education portal](https://intuneeducation.portal.azure.com), and [assign](/intune-education/assign-apps) it to your Windows 11 SE devices.

For more information on Intune requirements for adding education apps, see [Manage devices running Windows 11 SE](/intune-education/windows-11-se-overview).

### 0x87D300D9 error with an app

When you deploy an app using Intune for Education, you may get a `0x87D300D9` error code with a `Failed` state in the [Intune for Education portal](https://intuneeducation.portal.azure.com). If you have an app that fails with this error, then:

- Make sure the app is on the [available apps list](#available-apps) (in this article). Or, make sure your app is [approved for Windows 11 SE](#add-your-own-apps) (in this article).
- If the app is approved, then it's possible the app is packaged wrong. For more information, see [Add your own apps](#add-your-own-apps) (in this article) and [Manage devices running Windows 11 SE](/intune-education/windows-11-se-overview).
- If the app isn't approved, then it won't run on Windows 11 SE. To get apps approved, see [Add your own apps](#add-your-own-apps) (in this article). Or, use an app that runs in a web browser, such as a web app or PWA.
