# Switch to Windows 10 Pro Education in S mode from Windows 10 Pro in S mode
The S mode switch motion enables users to switch to Windows 10 Pro Education in S mode from Windows 10 Pro in S mode. This gives users access to the Microsoft Store for Education and to other Education offers.

## Benefits of Windows 10 Pro in S mode for Education

S mode is an enhanced security mode of Windows 10 – streamlined for security and superior performance. With Windows 10 in S mode, everyone can download and install Microsoft-verified apps from the Microsoft Store for Education – this mode keeps devices running fast and secure day in and day out. 

- **Microsoft-verified security** - It reduces risk of malware and exploitations that harm students and educators, because only Microsoft-verified apps can be installed.
- **Performance that lasts** - Provides all-day battery life to keep students on task and not tripping over cords. Also, verified apps won’t degrade device performance over time.
- **Streamlined for Speed** - Offers faster log-in times so teachers spend less time waiting and more time teaching.

### Windows 10 in S mode is safe, secure, and fast.  
However, in some limited scenarios, you might need to switch to Windows 10 Education. You can switch devices running Windows 10, version 1709 or later. Use the following information to switch to Windows 10 Pro through the Microsoft Store. 

## How to switch

### Devices running Windows 10, version 1803

**Switch using the Microsoft Store for Education**<BR>
There are two switch options available using the Microsoft Store for Education:

Tenant-wide Windows 10 Pro in S mode > Pro Education in S mode <BR>
Tenant-wide Windows 10 Pro > Pro Education

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While it’s free to switch to Windows 10 Pro, it’s not reversible. The only way to roll back this kind of switch is through a [bare metal recovery (BMR)](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/create-media-to-run-push-button-reset-features-s14) reset. This restores a Windows device to the factory state, even if the user needs to replace the hard drive or completely wipe the drive clean. If a device is switched out of S mode via the Microsoft Store, it will remain out of S mode even after the device is reset.

### Devices running Windows 10, version 1709

1. **Bulk switch through Microsoft Store for Education** - In this scenario, the global admin for the Azure AD education tenant can use Microsoft Store to switch all Windows 10 Pro in S mode devices on the tenant to Windows 10 Pro Education. (Devices running Windows 10, version 1803 will switch to Windows 10 Pro EDU in S mode.)

2. **Key acquisition options** - For schools with **active Microsoft Volume Licensing** agreements, global admins can obtain free MAK keys for Windows 10 Pro Education. For schools without an active Microsoft Volume Licensing agreement, the global admin can contact CSS, fill out a form and provide a proof of purchase to receive MAK keys for Windows 10 Pro Education.

> [!NOTE]
> There is currently no "bulk-switch" option for devices running Windows 10, version 1803.
