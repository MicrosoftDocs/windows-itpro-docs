# What's new in Set up School PCs
Learn what’s new with the Set up School PCs app each week. Find out about new app features and functionality, and see updated screenshots. You'll also find information about past releases.   

## Week of December 31, 2019

### Add Microsoft Whiteboard to provisioning package  
Microsoft Whiteboard has been added to the list of Microsoft-recommended apps for schools. Whiteboard is a freeform digital canvas where ideas, content, and people come together so students can create and collaborate in real time in the classroom. You can add Whiteboard to your provisioning package in Set up School PCs, on the **Add apps** page. For more information see [Use Set up School PCs app](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#create-the-provisioning-package).  

## Week of November 5, 2018  

### Sync school app inventory from Microsoft Store
During setup, you can now add apps from your school's Microsoft Store inventory. After you sign in with your school's Office 365 account, Set up School PCs will sync the apps from Microsoft Store, and make them visible on the **Add apps** page. For more information about adding apps, see [Use Set Up School PCs app](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#create-the-provisioning-package).   


## Week of October 15, 2018

The Set up School PCs app was updated with the following changes:

### Three new setup screens added to the app
The following screens and functionality were added to the setup workflow. Select any screenname to view the relevant steps and screenshots in the Set Up School PCs docs.  

* [**Package name**](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#package-name): Customize a package name to make it easy to recognize it from your school's other packages. The name is generated by Azure Active Directory and appears as the filename and as the token name in Azure AD in the Azure portal.  

* [**Product key**](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#product-key): Enter a product key to upgrade your current edition of Windows 10, or change the existing product key. 

* [**Personalization**](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#personalization): Upload images from your computer to customize how the lock screen and background appears on student devices.

### Azure AD token expiration extended to 180 days
Packages now expire 180 days from the date you create them.  

### Updated apps with more helpful, descriptive text 
We've updated the app's **Skip** buttons to clarify the intent of each action. You'll also see an **Exit** button on the last page of the app.  

### Option to keep existing device names
The [**Name these devices** screen](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#device-names) now gives you the option to keep the orginal or existing names of your student devices.   

### Skype and Messaging apps to be removed from student PCs by default
We've added the Skype and Messaging app to a selection of apps that are, by default, removed from student devices.
